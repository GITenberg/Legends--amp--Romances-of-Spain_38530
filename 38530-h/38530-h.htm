<p class="first">Since the days of Southey the romantic literature of
Spain has not received from English writers and critics the amount of
study and attention it undoubtedly deserves. In no European country did
the seeds of Romance take root so readily or blossom so speedily and
luxuriantly as in Spain, which perhaps left the imprint of its national
character more deeply upon the literature of chivalry than did France
or England. When we think of chivalry, do we not think first of Spain,
of her age-long struggle against the pagan invaders of Europe, her
sensitiveness to all that concerned personal and national honour, of
the names of the Cid Campeador, Gayferos, and Gonzalvo de Cordova,
gigantic shadows in harness, a pantheon of heroes, which the martial
legends of few lands can equal and none surpass. The epic of our
British Arthur, the French <i lang="fr">chansons de gestes</i>, are
indebted almost as much to folklore as to the imagination of the
singers who first gave them literary shape. But in the romances of
Spain we find that folklore plays an inconsiderable part, and that her
chivalric fictions are either the offspring of historic happenings or
of that brilliant and glowing imagination which illumines the whole
expanse of Peninsular literature.</p>
<p>I have given more space to the proofs of connexion between the
French <i lang="fr">chansons de gestes</i> and the Spanish <i lang=
"es">cantares de gesta</i> than most of my predecessors who have
written of Castilian romantic story. Indeed, with the exception of Mr
Fitzmaurice Kelly, whose admirable work in the field of Spanish letters
forms so happy an exception to our national neglect of a great
literature, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd19e245" href="#xd19e245"
name="xd19e245">7</a>]</span>I am aware of no English writer who has
concerned himself with this subject. My own opinion regarding the
almost total lack of Moorish influence upon the Spanish
<i>romanceros</i> is in consonance with that of critics much better
qualified to pass judgment upon such a question. But for my
classification of the ballad I am indebted to no one, and this a long
devotion to the study of ballad literature perhaps entitles me to make.
I can claim, too, that my translations are not mere paraphrases, but
provide renderings of tolerable accuracy.</p>
<p>I have made an earnest endeavour to provide English readers with a
conspectus of Spanish romantic literature as expressed in its
<i>cantares de gesta</i>, its chivalric novels, its <i>romanceros</i>
or ballads, and some of its lighter aspects. The reader will find full
accounts and summaries of all the more important works under each of
these heads, many of which have never before been described in
English.</p>
<p>If the perusal of this book leads to the more general study of the
noble and useful Castilian tongue on the part of but a handful of those
who read it, its making will have been justified. The real brilliance
and beauty of these tales lie behind the curtains of a language unknown

<p class="first">If, spent with journeying, a stranger should seat
himself in some garden in old Granada, and from beneath a tenting of
citron and mulberry leaves open his ears to the melody of the waters of
the City of Pomegranates and his spirit to the sorcery of its
atmosphere, he will gladly believe that in the days when its colours
were less mellow and its delicious air perhaps less reposeful the harps
of its poets were the looms upon which the webs of romance were woven.
Almost instinctively he will form the impression that the Spaniard,
having regained this paradise after centuries of exile, and stirred by
the enchanted echoes of Moorish music which still lingered there, was
roused into passionate song in praise of those heroes of his race who
had warred so ceaselessly and sacrificed so much to redeem it. But if
he should climb the Sierra del Sol and pass through the enchanted
chambers of the Alhambra as a child passes through the courts of dream,
he will say in his heart that the men who builded these rooms from the
rainbow and painted these walls from the palette of the sunset raised
also the invisible but not less gorgeous palace of Spanish Romance.</p>
<p>Or if one, walking in the carven shadows of Cordova, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>think on
the mosque Maqsura, whose doors of Andalusian brass opened to
generations of poets and astrologers, or on the palace of Azzahra,
built of rose and sea-coloured marbles rifled from the Byzantine
churches of Ifrikia, will he not believe that in this city of shattered
splendours and irretrievable spells the passion-flower of Romance burst
forth full-blown?</p>
<p>But we cannot trace the first notes of the forgotten musics nor
piece together the mosaic of broken harmonies in the warm and sounding
cities of the Saracens, neither in &ldquo;that mine of silk and
silver,&rdquo; old Granada, nor among the marble memories of Cordova,
whose market-place overflowed with the painted parchments of Moorish
song and science. We must turn our backs on the scarlet southern land
and ascend to the bare heights of Castile and Asturias, where Christian
Spain, prisoned for half a thousand years upon a harsh and arid
plateau, and wrought to a high passion of sacrifice and patriotism,
burst into a glory of martial song, the echoes of which resound among
its mountains like ghostly clarions on a field of old encounter.</p>
<p>Isolation and devotion to a national cause are more powerful as
incentives to the making of romance than an atmosphere of Eastern
luxuriance. The breasts of these stern sierras were to give forth milk
sweeter than the wine of Almohaden, and song more moving if less
fantastic arose in Burgos and Carri&oacute;n than ever inspired the
guitars of Granada. But the unending conflict of Arab and Spaniard
brought with it many interchanges between the sensuous spirit of the
South and the more rugged manliness of the North, so that at last
Saracen gold damascened the steel of Spanish song, and the nets of
Eastern phantasy wound themselves about the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>Spanish
soul. In a later day an openly avowed admiration for the art and
culture of the Moslem leavened the ancient hate, and the Moorish
cavalier imitated the chivalry, if not the verse, of the Castilian
knight.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e577src" href="#xd19e577" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The homeland of Spanish tradition was indeed a fitting
nursery for the race which for centuries contested every acre of the
Peninsula with an enemy greatly more advanced in the art of warfare, if
inferior in resolution and the spirit of unity. Among the flinty wastes
of the north of Spain, which are now regarded as rich in mineral
resources, are situated at intervals luxuriant and fertile valleys sunk
deep between the knees of volcanic ridges, the lower slopes of which
are covered with thick forests of oak, chestnut, and pine. These
depressions, sheltered from the sword-like winds which sweep down from
the Pyrenees, reproduce in a measure the pleasant conditions of the
southern land. Although their distance one from another tended to
isolation, it was in these valleys that Christian Spain received the
respite which enabled her to collect her strength and school her spirit
for the great struggle against the Saracen.</p>
<p>In this age-long contest she was undoubtedly inspired by that subtle
sense of nationhood and the possession of a common tongue which have
proved the salvation of many races no less desperately situated, and
perhaps her determination to redeem the lost Eden of the South is the
best measure of the theory that, prior to the era of Saracen conquest,
the Castilian tongue was a mere <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>jargon, composed of the elements
of the Roman <i lang="la">lingua rustica</i> and the rude Gothic, and,
according to some authorities, still lacking in grammatical arrangement
and fixity of idiom.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e595src" href=
"#xd19e595" name="xd19e595src">2</a> It is certainly clear that the
final phases in the evolution of Castilian took place subsequently to
the Arabic invasion, but it is a straining of such scanty evidence as
we possess to impute to the form of Castilian speech current
immediately before that time the character of an undisciplined
<i>patois</i>.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e608" class="main">Roman and Visigoth</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When in the early part of the fifth century the
Visigoths, following in the wake of the Vandal folk, entered Romanized
Spain, they did not build upon the ruins of its civilization, but
retained the habits of their northern homeland and for some generations
seem to have been little impressed with Roman culture. Nor did the
Latin speech of the people they had conquered at first find favour
among them, although, dwelling as they had done on the very flanks of
the Empire, they were certainly not ignorant of it. They found the
people of the Peninsula as little inclined to relinquish the cultivated
language in which their compatriots Martial, Lucan, and Seneca had
contributed to the triumphs of Roman letters. A military autocracy is
not usually successful in imposing its language upon a subject people
unless it possesses the dual advantages <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>of an ascendancy in arms
and literary capacity, and the Visigoths, unable to compete in this
latter respect with the highly civilized colonists of Hispania, fell,
with the passing of the generations, into the easy acceptance of the
Roman tongue. Their illiteracy, however, was not the sole reason for
their partial defeat in the give-and-take of linguistic strife, for,
though powerful in military combination, they were greatly outmatched
in numbers. As invaders they had brought few women with them, and had
perforce to intermarry with native wives, who taught their children the
Roman tongue. The necessary intercourse between conqueror and conquered
in time produced a sort of pidgin-Latin, which stood in much the same
relation to the classic speech of Rome as the trade languages of the
Pacific did to English.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e614src" href=
"#xd19e614" name="xd19e614src">3</a></p>
<p>The use of Latin as a literary tongue in that part of Spain where
the Castilian speech was evolved considerably retarded its development
from the condition of a <i>patois</i> to a language proper.
Nevertheless it continued to advance. The processes by which it did so
are surprisingly obscure, but the circumstance of its literary fixity
in the early eleventh century is proof that it must have achieved
colloquial perfection at least before the era of the Moorish invasion.
The Saracen conquest, by forcing it into the bleak north-west, did it
small disservice, for there it had to contend with other dialects of
the Roman tongue, which enriched its vocabulary, and over which,
ultimately, it gained almost complete ascendancy as a literary
language. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e627" class="main">The Romance Tongues of Spain</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Three Romance or Roman languages were spoken in that
portion of Spain which remained in Christian hands: in Catalonia and
Aragon the Proven&ccedil;al, Catalan, or Limousin; in Asturias, Old
Castile, and Leon the Castilian; and in Galicia the Gallego, whence the
Portuguese had its origin. The Catalan was almost entirely similar to
the Proven&ccedil;al or <i lang="fr">langue d&rsquo;oc</i> of Southern
France, and the accession of Raymond Berenger, Count of Barcelona, to
the throne of Provence in 1092 united the Catalonian and
Proven&ccedil;al peoples under one common rule. Proven&ccedil;al, the
language of the Troubadours, was of French origin, and bears evidence
of its evolution from the Latin of Provincial Gaul. It appears to have
been brought into Catalonia by those Hispani who had fled to Provence
from Moorish rule, and who gradually drifted southward again as the
more northerly portions of Spain were freed from Arab aggression. The
political connexion of Catalonia with Provence naturally brought about
a similarity of custom as well as of speech, and indeed we find the
people of the Catalan coast and the province of Aragon deeply imbued
with the chivalry and gallantry of the more northerly home of the
<i>Gai Saber</i>.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e638width" id="p016"><img src="images/p016.jpg"
alt="A Glimpse of Old Spain" width="496" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">A Glimpse of Old Spain</p>
</div>
<p>Throughout the whole Proven&ccedil;al-Catalan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e644src" href="#xd19e644" name="xd19e644src">4</a> tract were held
those romantic courts of love in which the erotic subtleties of its men
and women of song were debated with a seriousness which shows that the
art of love had entered into competition with the forces of law and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>religion, and had, indeed, become the real
business of life with the upper classes of the country. Out of this
glorification of the relations of the sexes arose the allied science of
chivalry, no less punctilious or extravagant in its code and spirit.
This spirit of Proven&ccedil;al chivalry gradually found its way into
Castile, heightened and quickened the imagination of its people, and
prepared the Spanish mind for the acceptance and appreciation of
Romantic literature. But at no time was Castilian imagination passively
receptive. It subjected every literary force which invaded it to such a
powerful alchemy of transmutation that in time all foreign elements
lost their alien character and emerged from the crucible of Spanish
thought as things almost wholly Castilian.</p>
<p>The perfection of rhyming verse was undoubtedly accomplished by the
Troubadour poets of Provence and Catalonia, and opened the way for a
lyric poetry which, if it never attained any loftiness of flight or
marked originality of expression, has seldom been surpassed in melody
and finish. But it is remarkable that this extensive body of verse, if
a few political satires be excepted, has but one constant
theme&mdash;the exaltation of love. A perusal of the poetry of the
pleasant Proven&ccedil;al tongue pleases the ear and appeals to the
musical sense. The melody is never at fault, and we can count upon the
constancy of a pavane-like stateliness, which proceeds, perhaps, as
much from the genius of the language as from the metrical excellences
of its singers. But the monotonous repetition of amatory sentiment, for
the expression of which the same conceptions and even the same phrases
are again and again compelled to do duty, the artificial spirit which
inspires these uniform cadences, and the lack of real human
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>warmth soon weary and disappoint the reader, who
will gladly resign the entire poetical kingdom of Provence to the
specialist in prosody or the literary antiquary in exchange for the
freer and less formal beauties of a music better suited to human needs
and less obviously designed for the uses of a literary caste. The
poetry of Provence reminds us of those tapestries in which the scheme
is wholly decorative, where stiff, brocaded flowers occupy regular
intervals in the pattern and a monotonous sameness of colour is the
distinctive note. No episode of the chase nor pastoral scene charms us
by its liveliness or reality, nor do we find the silken hues
distributed in a natural and pleasing manner.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e659src" href="#xd19e659" name="xd19e659src">5</a></p>
<p>The Proven&ccedil;al and Catalan troubadours had, indeed, a certain
influence upon the fortunes of Castilian poetry and romance, and proofs
of their early intercourse with Castile are numerous. The
thirteenth-century <i>Book of Apollonius</i>, an anonymous poem, is
full of Proven&ccedil;alisms, as is the rather later <i>History of the
Crusades</i>. During the persecution they suffered at the period of the
Albigensian wars numbers of them fled into Spain, where they found a
refuge from their intolerant enemies. Thus Aimeric de Bellinai fled to
the Court of Alfonso IX,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e673src" href=
"#xd19e673" name="xd19e673src">6</a> and was later at the Court of
Alfonso X, as were Montagnagunt and Folquet de Lunel, as well as
Raimond de Tours and Bertrand Carbunel, who, with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>Riquier,
either dedicated their works to that monarch or composed elegies on the
occasion of his death. King Alfonso himself wrote verses of a decidedly
Proven&ccedil;al cast, and even as late as 1433 the Marquis de Villena,
a kinsman of the famous Marquis de Santillana, whom we shall encounter
later, wrote a treatise upon the art of the Troubadours,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e680src" href="#xd19e680" name="xd19e680src">7</a>
which, following the instincts of a pedant, he desired to see
resuscitated in Castile.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e690src" href=
"#xd19e690" name="xd19e690src">8</a></p>
<p>The Galician, a Romance language which sprang from the same root as
the Portuguese, is nearly allied to the Castilian. But it is not so
rich in guttural sounds, from which we may be correct in surmising that
it has less of the Teutonic in its composition than the sister tongue.
Like Portuguese, it possesses an abundance of hissing sounds, and a
nasal pronunciation not unlike the French, which was in all probability
introduced by the early establishment of a Burgundian dynasty upon the
throne. But Galician influence upon Castilian literature ceased at an
early period, although the reverse was by no means the case.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e702" class="main">The Rise of Castilian</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The evolution of Castilian from the original Latin
spoken by the Roman colonists in Spain was complicated by many local
circumstances. Thus in contracting the vocables of the Roman tongue it
did not omit the same syllables as the Italian, nor did it give such
brevity to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>them as Proven&ccedil;al or Galician. Probably
because of the greater admixture of Gothic blood among those who spoke
it, it is rich in aspirates, and has a stronger framework than almost
any of the Romance tongues. Thus the Latin <i>f</i> is in Castilian
frequently altered to <i>h</i>, as <i lang="es">hablar</i> = <i lang=
"la">fabulari</i>, &lsquo;to speak.&rsquo; The letter <i>j</i>, which
is strongly aspirated, is frequently substituted for the liquid
<i>l</i>, so that <i lang="la">filius</i>, &lsquo;a son,&rsquo; becomes
<i lang="es">hijo</i>. Liquid <i>ll</i> in its turn takes the place of
Latin <i>pl</i>, and we find Latin <i lang="la">planus</i>,
&lsquo;smooth,&rsquo; appearing in Castilian as <i lang="es">llano</i>
(<i>pron.</i> ly&aacute;h-no). The Spanish <i>ch</i> supplies the place
of the Latin <i>ct</i>, as <i>facto</i> = <i lang="es">hecho</i>,
<i lang="la">dictu</i> = <i lang="es">dicho</i>, and so on.</p>
<p>Other proofs of Teutonic association are not lacking. Thus the
<i>g</i> before <i>c</i> and <i>i</i>, which in Gothic and German is a
guttural, has the same character in Castilian. The Spanish conversion
of <i>o</i> into <i>ue</i> also resembles the similar change in German,
if, for example, we compare Castilian <i lang="es">cuerpo</i> and
<i lang="es">pueblo</i> with the German <i lang="de">K&ouml;rper</i>
and <i lang="de">P&ouml;bel</i>.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e799" class="main">Southward Spread of Castilian</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The rise of Castilian as a colloquial and literary
tongue was achieved by the ceaseless struggle of the hardy race who
spoke it against the Saracen occupation of their native land. As the
Castilian warriors by generations of hard fighting gradually regained
city after city and district by district rather than province by
province, their language encroached by degrees upon the area of that of
their Arab enemies,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e803src" href="#xd19e803"
name="xd19e803src">9</a> until at length the last stronghold of the
Moors fell and left them not a foothold in the Peninsula. &ldquo;It was
indeed a rude training <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21"
name="pb21">21</a>]</span>which our forefathers, mighty and hardy, had
as a prelude to so many glories and to the conquest of the
world,&rdquo; says Martinez in his novel <i>Isabel de
Solis</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e811src" href="#xd19e811" name=
"xd19e811src">10</a> &ldquo;Weighed down by their harness and with
sword in hand, they slept at ease no single night for eight
centuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the period of the defeat of Roderic, &ldquo;last of the
Visigoths,&rdquo; at the battle of Xerez de la Frontera in 711 until
the fall of Granada in 1492, Spain was indeed a land of battles. Almost
immediately after their first defeat by Arab arms the armies of the
Visigoths were pursued to the north-western limits of the Peninsula,
where they, found a rallying-place in the mountains of Biscay and
Asturias. There, like the Welsh after the Saxon invasion of Britain,
they might have become reconciled to the comparatively narrow area left
to them, but the circumstances of their virtual imprisonment served
only to unite them more closely in a common nationality and a common
resolve to win back their original possessions.</p>
<p>For many generations their efforts were confined to border forays
and guerrilla fighting, in which they were by no means uniformly
successful, for the fiery courage of the Saracens would permit of no
mere defensive policy, and nearly every victory of which the Castilians
could boast was counterbalanced by reverses and losses which their
inferior numbers could ill sustain. But by degrees their valorous
obstinacy was rewarded, and ere a century had passed they had regained
the greater part of Old Castile. The very name of this province,
meaning as it does &lsquo;the Land of Castles,&rsquo; shows that even
when regained it was held only by fortifying its every hill-top with
strongholds, so that at last this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>castellated tract gave its name
to the race which held it so dearly. Before another twenty years had
passed the Castilian warriors had established a footing in New Castile,
and from this time onward seem to have been assured of ultimate
success.</p>
<p>The fall of Toledo in 1085, after three centuries and a half of
Saracen occupation, marked a further epoch in the southern advance of
the Castilians, and by the taking of Saragossa in 1118 the tables were
turned upon the Arab invaders, who were now driven into a more confined
part of the country, to the south and south-west. This circumstance,
however, seems to have consolidated rather than crippled their
resisting powers, and they had yet to be reckoned with for nearly four
centuries ere, with the fall of Granada, Boabdil, or Abu-Abdallah, the
last of the Moorish kings, gave up its keys to Ferdinand of Castile,
looked his last upon the city, and crossed to Africa to fling away his
life in battle.</p>
<p>In these circumstances of constant strife and unrest the Romantic
literature of Spain was born. It is by no means remarkable that its
development coincided with the clash of arms. Trumpets re-echo in its
every close. As it expresses the spirit of a martial race, it was also
the nursling of necessity, for from the songs and fables of mighty
heroes the knights of Castile drew a new courage and experienced an
emulous exhilaration which nerved them on the day of battle. Well might
the wandering knight of Castile chant, as in the old ballad:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Oh, harness is my only wear,</p>
<p class="line">The battle is my play:</p>
<p class="line">My pallet is the desert bare,</p>

<h3 id="xd19e843" class="main">The Literary Development of
Castilian</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Castilian, although more than one alien influence
impinged upon it, evolved a literary shape peculiarly its own,
especially as regards its verse, as will be seen when we come to deal
separately with its several Romantic forms. Thus it owed nothing to the
literary methods of Proven&ccedil;al or Catalan, though much to their
spirit and outward manners. When the courtly and rather pedantic poetic
system of the Troubadours encountered the grave and vigorous Castilian,
it was ill fitted to make any prolonged resistance. As political causes
had hastened their encounter, so they quickened the victory of the
Castilian. The ruling power in Aragon had from an early period been
connected with Castilian royalty, and Ferdinand the Just, who came to
the throne of Aragon in 1412, was a Castilian prince. The Courts of
Valencia and Burgos were, therefore, practically open to the same
political influences. If our conclusions are correct, it was during the
reigns of Ferdinand the Just and Alfonso V (1412&ndash;58) that the
influence of Castilian first invaded the sphere of Catalan. We find it
definitely recognized as a poetic tongue on the occasion of a contest
of song in honour of the Madonna held at Valencia in 1474, the forty
poems sung at which were afterward collected in the first book printed
in Spain. Four of these are in the Castilian tongue, which was thus
evidently regarded as a literary medium sufficiently developed to be
represented at such a contest. Valencia, indeed, at first wholly
Catalan in speech and art, seems to have possessed a school of
Castilian poets of its own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>from 1470 to 1550, who did much to
popularize their adopted tongue. But the Catalonians were not minded
that their language should lose the literary hegemony of Spain so
easily, and they made every endeavour to sustain it by instituting
colleges of professional troubadours and vaunting its beauties at their
great public contests of song. It was in vain. They had encountered a
language more vigorous, more ample in vocabulary, more rich in
idiomatic construction, and backed by a stronger political power than
their own.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e850" class="main">The Poetical Courts of Castile</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The evolution of Castilian as a literary language was
also assiduously fostered by the scholarly character of many of the
rulers of Castile. Alfonso the Wise was himself a poet, and cultivated
his native tongue with judiciousness and care, affording it purity and
precision of expression. Under his supervision the Scriptures were
translated into Castilian, and a <i>General Chronicle of Spain</i> as
well as a history of the First Crusade were undertaken at his instance.
He made it the language of the law-courts, and attempted to infuse into
its verse a more exact spirit and poetical phraseology by the imitation
of Proven&ccedil;al models.</p>
<p>Alfonso XI composed a <i>General Chronicle</i> in the easy, flowing
rhyme of the native <i>redondillas</i>, instead of the stiff, monkish
Alexandrines then current in literary circles, and caused books to be
written in Castilian prose on the art of hunting and the genealogy of
the nobility.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e865src" href="#xd19e865" name=
"xd19e865src">12</a> His relative Don Juan Manuel did much to
discipline Spanish imagination and give fixity to Spanish prose in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=

ethical and political maxims, the morals of which are well pointed by
tales and fables drawn from history and classical literature. Juan
II,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e880src" href="#xd19e880" name=
"xd19e880src">14</a> although a weak and idle monarch, was a great
patron of letters, wrote verses, associated with poets, and caused a
large collection of the best existing Spanish verse to be made in 1449.
But the spirit of his Court was a pedantic one; it strayed after
Italian models, and he himself affected the Proven&ccedil;al manner.
Despite such artificial barriers, however, Castilian speech continued
to advance upon its conquering way. It had definitely become the
language of Romance, and Romance, within a generation of this period,
was to become the most powerful literary form in the Peninsula.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e884" class="main">The Rise of Romance</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The development of Romance in Spain, its evolution and
the phases through which it passed, has not, as a theme, met with that
painstaking treatment at the hands of English writers on Spanish
literature that might have been expected at this late day, when the
literary specialist has to search diligently into the remotest corners
of the earth if he seek new treasures to assay. Its several phases are
rather hinted at than definitely laid down, not because of the poverty
or dubiety of the evidential material so much as through the laxity and
want of thoroughness which characterize most Britannic efforts at
epochal fixation or attempts to elucidate the connexion between
successive literary phases. I can scarcely hope to succeed in a task
which other and better equipped authorities have neglected, perhaps for
sound reasons. But I had rather fail in an attempt to reduce the
details <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>of the evolution of Spanish Romance to orderly
sequence than place before the reader an array of unrelated facts and
isolated tags of evidence which, however interesting, present no
definite picture, permit of no reasonable deduction, and are usually
accompanied by a theoretical peradventure or so by way of dubious
enlightenment.</p>
<p>If we regard the literary map of Europe from the eleventh to the
thirteenth century we behold the light shining from two
quarters&mdash;Jewish-Arabic Spain and France. With the first we have,
at the moment, no concern. Its literature was at the time alien and
inimical to Christian Spain, which, as we shall see later, did not
regard anything Saracen with complacence until its sword crossed no
longer with the <span class="corr" id="xd19e892" title=
"Source: scimetar">scimitar</span>. But in France Castile had an
illustrious exemplar, whose lessons it construed in its own peculiar
manner&mdash;a manner dictated both by national pride and political
necessity.</p>
<p>With the influence of Southern France we have already dealt. At the
era alluded to, Northern France, the country of the <i>langue
d&rsquo;o&iuml;l</i>, although in a measure disturbed by unrest, was
yet in a much better case to produce great literature than Castile,
whose constant vendetta with the Moslem left her best minds only a
margin of leisure for the production of pure literature&mdash;a margin,
however, of which the fullest advantage was taken. The rise of a caste
of itinerary poets in France supplied the popular demand for
story-telling, and the <i lang="fr">trouv&egrave;res</i> of the twelfth
century recognized in the glorious era of Charlemagne a fitting and
abundant source for heroic fiction such as would appeal to medieval
audiences. The poems, or rather epics, which they based upon the
history of the Carlovingian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>period were known as <i lang=
"fr">chansons de gestes</i>, &lsquo;songs of the deeds&rsquo; of the
great Frankish emperor and his invincible paladins, or, to the <i lang=
"fr">trouv&egrave;res</i> themselves, as <i lang="fr">mati&egrave;re de
France</i>, as the Arthurian tales were designated <i lang=
"fr">mati&egrave;re de Bretagne</i>, and those based upon classical
history <i lang="fr">mati&egrave;re de Rome</i>.</p>
<p>Until comparatively recent times these immense works, many of which
comprise six or seven thousand lines of verse, were practically
unknown, even to the generality of literary authorities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e923src" href="#xd19e923" name="xd19e923src">15</a>
As we now possess them they are comparatively late in form, and have
undergone much revisal, probably for the worse. But they are the oldest
examples of elaborate verse in any modern language, with the exception
of English and Norse, and undoubtedly stand in an ancestral relation to
all modern European literature.</p>
<p>These <i lang="fr">chansons</i> were intended to be sung in the
common halls of feudal dwellings by the itinerant <i lang=
"fr">trouv&egrave;res</i>, who composed or passed them on to one
another. Their subject-matter deals more with the clash of arms than
the human emotions, though these are at intervals depicted in a
masterly manner. The older examples among them are written in batches
of lines, varying from one to several score, each of which derives
unity from an assonant vowel-rhyme, and known as <i lang=
"fr">laisses</i> or <i lang="fr">tirades</i>. Later, however, rhyme
crept into the <i lang="fr">chansons</i>, the entire <i lang=
"fr">laisse</i>, or batch, ending in a single rhyme-sound. <span class=

<h3 id="xd19e964" class="main">Castilian Opposition to the Chansons de
Gestes</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In these poems, which probably originated in the north
of France, the <i>genre</i> spreading southward as time progressed,
Charlemagne is represented as the great bulwark of Christianity against
the Saracens of Spain. Surrounded by his peers, Roland, Oliver, Naymes,
Ogier, and William of Orange, he wages constant warfare against the
Moors or the &lsquo;Saracens&rsquo; (pagans) of Saxony. Of these poems
Gautier has published a list of one hundred and ten, a moiety of which
date from the twelfth century. A number of the later <i lang=
"fr">chansons</i> are in Proven&ccedil;al, but all attempts to refer
the entire cycle in its original condition to that literature have
signally failed.</p>
<p>That this immense body of romantic material found its way into
Castile is positively certain. Whether it did so by way of Provence and
Catalonia is not clear, but it is not impossible that such was the
case. It might be thought that Christian Spain, in the throes of her
struggle with the Moors, took kindly to a literature so constant in its
reference to the discomfiture of her hereditary foes. At first she did
so, and certainly accepted the <i>chanson</i> form. But two barriers to
her undivided appreciation of it presently appeared. In the first
place, the Castilian of the twelfth century seems to have been aware
that if Charlemagne invaded Spain at all, he encountered not only the
Moor but the Spaniard as well. This is not borne out, as some
authorities imply, by a piece in the popular poetry of the Basques
known as the <i lang="es">Altobiskarko Cantar</i>, or <i>Song of
Altobiskar</i>, which tacitly asserts that the defeat of
Charlemagne&rsquo;s rearguard at Roncesvalles was due not to Saracens,
but to Basques, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>who resented the passage of the Frankish army
through their mountain passes. The whole piece is an effusion written
in Basque by a Basque student named Duhalde, who translated it from the
French of Fran&ccedil;ois Garay de Montglave (<i>c.</i> 1833).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e991src" href="#xd19e991" name="xd19e991src">16</a> A
second battle of Roncesvalles took place in the reign of Louis le
Debonair in 824, when two Frankish counts returning from Spain were
again surprised and defeated by the Pyrenean mountaineers. But there
appears to have been a still earlier battle between Franks and Basques
in the Pyrenees in the reign of Dagobert I (631&ndash;638). The
folk-memory of these contests seems to have been kept alive, so that
the Spaniard felt that the Frank was somewhat of a traditional enemy.
Archbishop Roderic of Toledo inveighed against those Spanish
<i>juglares</i> who sang the battles of Charlemagne in Spain, and
Alfonso the Learned belittles the mythical successes of the Frankish
emperor.</p>
<p>But this was not all. The idea that Charlemagne had entered Spain as
a conqueror, carrying all before him, was offensive to the highly
wrought pride and patriotism of the Castilians, who chose to interpret
the spirit of the <i lang="fr">chansons de gestes</i> in their own way,
and, instead of copying them slavishly, raised an opposing body of song
to their detriment. Accepting as the national hero of the Carlovingian
era an imaginary knight, Bernaldo de Carpio, they hailed him as the
champion of Castile, and invented songs of their own in which he is
spoken of as slaying and defeating Roland at Roncesvalles at the head
of a victorious army composed not of Arabs or Basques, but Castilians.

<h3 id="xd19e1010" class="main">The Cantares de Gesta</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But if the Castilians did not accept the matter of the
<i>chansons</i>, they assuredly adopted their form. Their literary
revolt against the alien spirit and politics of the <i>chansons</i>
seems to have taken place at some time soon after the diffusion of
these throughout Spain. A Spanish priest of the early twelfth century
wrote the fabulous chronicle of Archbishop Turpin of Rheims, which
purported to be the work of that warlike cleric, but in reality was
intended to popularize the pilgrimage to Compostella to which it had
reference. Many Franks travelled to the shrine, among them
<i>trouv&egrave;res</i>, who in all likelihood passed on to the native
Castilian singers the spirit and metrical system of the
<i>chansons</i>, so that later we hear of Spanish <i>cantares de
gesta</i>, most of which, however, unlike their French models, are lost
to us. The famous <i lang="es">Poema del Cid</i>, dealing with the
exploits of a great Castilian hero, is nothing but a <i lang=
"es">cantar de gesta</i> in form and spirit, and we possess good
evidence that many of the late <i>romanceros</i> or ballads upon such
heroes as Bernaldo de Carpio, Gonzalvo de Cordova, and Gayferos are but
ancient <i>cantares</i> &lsquo;rubbed down,&rsquo; or in a state of
attrition.</p>
<p>As in France, so in Spain, degeneration overtook the <i>cantares de
gesta</i>. In course of time they were forced into the market-place and
the scullions&rsquo; hall. Many of them were worked into the substance
of chronicles and histories; but the <i>juglares</i> who now sang them
altered them, when they passed out of fashion, into corrupt
abridgments, or broke them up into ballads to suit the taste of a more
popular audience.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1050src" href="#xd19e1050"

<p class="first">But if the majority of the <i lang="es">cantares de

fragments of them in the ancient chronicles of Spain. Thus the
<i>General Chronicle of Spain</i> (<i>c.</i> 1252), which, according to
the latest research, is believed to have undergone at least three
specific alterations or rearrangements of its text, tells the stories
of Bernaldo de Carpio, Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez, and the seven
Children of Lara, and provides sketches of Charlemagne, while its
latter portion recounts the history of the Cid, and at times even
appeals to the <i lang="es">cantares</i> as its authority for such and
such an episode. Many of the passages in the chronicles, too, are
obviously copied in their entirety from certain <i lang=
"es">cantares</i>. So strongly, indeed, do they retain the assonant
verse-formation typical of the <i lang="es">cantares</i> that many of
the later balladeers seem easily to have cast them into verse again,
especially those relating to Bernaldo de Carpio and the Infantes de
Lara, and in this manner they appeared once more in the <i lang=

<h3 id="xd19e1085" class="main">The Ballads</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The immortal ballads of Spain have been the subject of
the sharpest controversy, and their importance as Romantic material
demands special treatment in a separate chapter. Regarding the period
to which they belong and their relations to the larger narrative poems
and chronicles, we must deal briefly with them here. Some authorities
ascribe them to an early age and insist upon their priority to such
poems as the <i lang="es">Poema del Cid</i> and such chronicles as that
of Alfonso the Learned, while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>others are equally assured of the
late date of the greater number. It seems to me that the truth resides
in both hypotheses, and that in this case, as frequently in literary
navigation, it is wise to steer a middle course. In my view the ballads
of Spain are of four fundamental types: those which arose spontaneously
in Northern Spain at some time subsequent to the formation of the
Castilian language, and which, if we possess any remnants of them at
all, have probably come down to us in such a form as would render them
unrecognizable to those who first sang them; ballads which are based on
passages in <i lang="es">cantares de gesta</i> as chronicles;
folk-ballads of a later date, more or less altered; and, lastly, the
more modern productions of conscious art.</p>
<p>I also believe that the ballads or <i lang="es">romanceros</i> are
again of two broad classes: those of spontaneous folk-origin, owing
nothing to literary sources, and those which are mainly <i lang=
"es">cantares de gesta</i>, or chronicle passages in a lyric state of
attrition. With the great body of authorities upon ancient Spanish
literature I do not believe that the <i lang="es">cantares</i> or
chronicles owe anything to the ballads of any age, which seem to me
wholly of popular origin. Of course the two classes lastly indicated do
not include the more &lsquo;poetic&rsquo; or sophisticated ballads
written after the ballad became an accepted form for experiments in
conscious versification, and it is plain that such efforts could belong
to neither category.</p>
<p>No definite proof exists as to the degree of sophistication and
alteration which the ballads underwent before their ultimate collection
and publication. It would be strange, however, if no ballads of
relatively early date had reached us, altered or otherwise, and it
seems to me merely a piece of critical affectation to deny antiquity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>to a song solely because it found its way into
print at a late period, or because it is not encountered in ancient
MSS., just as it would be to throw doubt upon the antiquity of a legend
or folk-custom current in our own day&mdash;unless; indeed, such should
display obvious marks of recent manufacture. At the same time few of
these ballads seem to me to bear the stamp of an antiquity more hoary
than, for example, those of Scotland or Denmark.</p>
<p>Few of the ballad systems of Europe are better worthy of study than
that of Spain. But in this place we are considering it merely from the
point of view of its bearings upon Romance. That it has a close
affinity with the Romantic literature of the Peninsula is evident from
the name given to these poems by the Spaniards, who call them <i lang=
"es">romanceros</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1117src" href=
"#xd19e1117" name="xd19e1117src">18</a> Some of them are, indeed,
romances or <i lang="es">cantares de gesta</i> in little, and in fact
they deal with all the great subjects sung of in the <i lang=
"es">cantares</i> or prosed upon in the chronicles, such as the Cid,
Bernaldo de Carpio, Count Alarcos, and so forth. But they seem to have
little in common with the later romances proper, such as <i>Amadis</i>,
<i>Palmerin</i>, or <i>Felixmarte</i>, for the good reason that by the
time these were in fashion the ballad had become the sole property of
the common people. As the Marquis de Santillana (1398&ndash;1458),
himself a poet of note, remarks in a letter famous for the light it
throws on the condition of Spanish literature in his day: &ldquo;There
are contemptible poets who, without order, rule, or rhythm, make those
songs and romances in which vulgar folk and menials <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>take
delight.&rdquo; So might Lovelace or Drummond of Hawthornden have
written of our own balladeers.</p>
<p>The ballads thus relegated to the peasantry and lower classes, those
of the upper classes who found time for reading were accordingly thrown
back upon the chronicles and the few <i lang="es">cantares de gesta</i>
which had been reduced to writing. But on the destruction of the
Moorish states in Spain the increase in wealth and leisure among the
upper classes, and the introduction of printing, aroused a demand for
books which would provide amusement. A great spirit of invention was
abroad. At first it resuscitated the Romantic matter lying embedded and
almost fossilized in the chronicles. It is, indeed, but a step from
some of these to the romances proper. But Spain hungrily craved
novelty, and the eyes of romance-makers were turned once more to
France, whose fictional wealth began to be exploited by Spanish writers
about the beginning of the fifteenth century.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Perhaps the first literary notice that we possess of
the romance proper in Spain is that by Ayala, Chancellor of Castile
(<i>d.</i> 1407), who, in his <i lang="es">Rimado de Palacio</i>,
deplores the time he has wasted in reading such &ldquo;lying
stuff&rdquo; as <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>. He might have been much worse
occupied, but, be that as it may, in his dictum we scarcely have a
forecast of the manner in which this especial type of romance was to
seize so mightily upon the Castilian imagination, which, instead of
being content with mere servile copying from French models, was to
re-endow them with a spirit and genius peculiarly Spanish. Perhaps in
no other European country did <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>the seed of Romance find a soil so
fitting for its germination and fruition, and certainly nowhere did it
blossom and burgeon in such an almost tropical luxuriance of fruit and
flower.</p>
<p><i>Amadis</i> had for sequel a long line of similar tales, all of
which the reader will encounter later in these pages. By general
consent of critics, from Cervantes onward, it is the best and most
distinctive of the Spanish romances, and was translated into French,
Italian, and indeed into most European languages,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e1166src" href="#xd19e1166" name="xd19e1166src">19</a> a special
translation, it is said, even being made for Jewish readers. At a
stroke Peninsular romanticism had beaten French chivalric fiction upon
its own ground. But <i>Amadis</i> was not, as Cervantes seems to think,
the first book of chivalry printed in Spain, for this distinction
belongs to <i>Tirante the White</i> (1490) which, according to Southey,
is lacking in the spirit of chivalry.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e1175src" href="#xd19e1175" name="xd19e1175src">20</a> Among other
figures it introduces that of Warwick the King-maker, who successfully
withstands an invasion of England by the King of the Canary Islands,
and ultimately slays the invader single-handed and routs his forces.
But if Cervantes errs in his bibliography, his barber&rsquo;s
summing-up of <i>Amadis</i> as &ldquo;the best of all books of its kind
that has been written&rdquo; is not far from the truth.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e1184src" href="#xd19e1184" name=
"xd19e1184src">21</a> Tasso thought it &ldquo;the most beautiful and
perhaps the most profitable story of its kind that can be read.&rdquo;
Did he merely follow the tonsorial critic&rsquo;s opinion, as his
language would tempt one to believe? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Amadis</i> was followed by a host of imitations. Its enormous
success, from a popular point of view, brought into being a whole
literature of similar stamp and intention, if not of equal quality. The
first of such efforts, in consequence if not in chronology, is that of
<i>Palmerin de Oliva</i>, the earliest known edition of which appeared
at Seville in 1525, and was followed, like the <i>Amadis</i>, by
similar continuations, <i>Primale&oacute;n</i>, <i>Platir</i>, and
<i>Palmerin of England</i>, perhaps the best of the series.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e1210src" href="#xd19e1210" name=
"xd19e1210src">22</a> Regarding the alleged Portuguese origin of
<i>Amadis</i> and <i>Palmerin</i> I have more to say elsewhere, and
will content myself here by observing that no Portuguese original,
printed or manuscript, exists, although the priority of such seems
undoubted. But these romances became as Castilian as the Arthurian
series became English, despite the latter&rsquo;s Brythonic or other
origin, and Spanish they have remained in the belief and imagination of
all Europe, popular as well as critical.</p>
<p>The <i>Palmerin</i> series only fed and increased the passion for
romantic fiction, so hungry was Spain for a literary diet which seemed
so natural and acceptable to her appetite that those who sought to
provide her with romantic reading could scarce cope with the call for
it. The natural result ensued. A perfect torrent of hastily written and
inferior fiction descended upon the public. Invention, at first bold,
became shameless, and in such absurdities of distorted imagination as
<i>Belianis of Greece</i>, <i>Olivante de Laura</i>, and <i>Felixmarte
of Hyrcania</i> the summit of romantic extravagance was reached. But
ridiculous and insulting to human intelligence and decent taste as most
of these productions were, still they found countless thousands of
readers, and there is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span>every indication that publishing in the Spain
of the late sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries must have been
extremely lucrative. These preposterous and chimerical tales, lacking
the beauty and true imaginative skill and simplicity of the older
romances, stood in much the same relation to them as a host of
imitative novels published in the early years of the nineteenth century
did to the romances of Scott. Mexia, the sarcastic historian of Charles
V, writing of romance in 1545, deplores the public credulity which
battened on such feeble stuff. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;there
be men who think all these things really happened, just as they read or
hear them, though the greater part of the things themselves are
absurd.&rdquo; So might a critic of our own day descant upon the
popular predilection for the cheap novel, or the whole desert of
sensation-fodder which pours from the all too rapid machines of the
Fiction Trusts.</p>
<p>Still another extravagant and more unpleasant manifestation of the
popular craze for romance arose in such religious tales as <i>The
Celestial Chivalry</i>, <i>The Knight of the Bright Star</i>, and
others of little worth, in which Biblical characters are endowed with
the attributes of chivalry and go on adventure bound. The time occupied
by the appearance of these varying types, and indeed in the whole
latter-day evolution of Spanish romance, was strikingly brief. But half
a century elapsed between the publication of <i>Amadis</i> and the most
extreme of its worthless imitations. But it is not difficult to account
for the rapid manufacture and dissemination of such a mass of
literature, good and bad, when we recall that Spain had been for ages
the land of active knighthood, that her imagination had been wrought to
a high pitch <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>of fervour in her long struggle with her pagan
enemies, and that in the tales of chivalry she now gazed upon with such
admiration she saw the reflection of her own courtly and heroic
spirit&mdash;the most sensitive and most fantastically chivalrous in
Europe.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1249" class="main">Possible Moorish Influence on Spanish
Romance</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is indeed evidence&mdash;pressed down and
flowing over&mdash;that the age-long death-grapple with the Saracen
powerfully affected Spanish romantic fiction. But was this influence a
direct one, arising out of the contiguity and constant perusal of the
body of Moorish fiction, or did it proceed from the atmosphere of
wonder which the Saracen left behind him in Spain, the illusions of
which were mightily assisted by the marvels of his architecture and his
art? One can scarcely find a Spanish romance that is not rich in
reference to the Moor, who is usually alluded to as a <i>caballero</i>
and a worthy foe. But is it the real Moor whom we encounter in these
tall folios, which beside our modern volumes seem as stately galleons
might in the company of ocean-going tramps, or is it the Saracen of
romance, an Oriental of fiction, like the Turk of Byronic literature?
The question of the influence of Moorish literature upon Spanish
romance has been shrouded by the most unfortunate popular
misconceptions. Let us briefly examine the spirit of Arabic literary
invention, and see in how far it was capable of influencing Castilian
art and imagination.</p>
<p>The history of the development of the Arabic language from the
dialect of a wandering desert people to a tongue the poetic
possibilities and colloquial uses of which are perhaps unrivalled is in
itself sufficient to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"
name="pb39">39</a>]</span>furnish a whole volume of romantic episode.
The form in which it was introduced into Spain in the early eighth
century can scarcely fail to arouse the admiration of the lover of
literary perfection. As a literary medium its development was rapid and
effective. It is, indeed, as if the tones of a harsh trumpet had by
degrees become merged into those of a silver clarion whose notes ring
out ever more clearly, until at length they arrive at a keenness so
intense as to become almost intolerably piercing. This eloquent
language, the true speech of the literary aristocrat, has through the
difficulty of its acquirement and the bewildering nature of its written
characters remained almost unknown to the great mass of
Europeans&mdash;unknown, too, because the process of translation is
inadequate to the proper conveyance of its finer shades and subtler
intimations. Even to the greater number of the Arabs of Spain the
highly polished verse in which their literature was so rich was
unknown. How much more, then, was it a force removed from the Castilian
or the Catalan?</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1261" class="main">Arabic Poetry</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The desert life of the Arabs while they were yet an
uncultured people, although it did not permit of the development of a
high standard of literary achievement, fostered the growth of a spirit
of observation so keen as to result in the creation of a wealth of
synonyms, by means of which the language became greatly enriched.
Synonymous meaning and the discovery of beautiful and striking
comparisons are the very pillars of poetry, and within a century of the
era of Moslem ascendancy in the East we find the brilliant dynasty of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>the Abbassides (<i>c.</i> <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 750) the generous patrons of a poetic literature which
the language was so well prepared to express. Story-telling had been a
favourite amusement among the Arabs of the desert, and they now found
the time-honoured, spontaneous exercise of the imaginative faculty
stand them in good stead. The rapidity of the progress of Arabic
literature at this period is, indeed, difficult of
realization<span class="corr" id="xd19e1273" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Poetry, which we are now assured has &lsquo;no
market value,&rsquo; was to the truly enlightened upper classes of this
people an art of the first importance, more precious than those bales
of the silks of Damascus, those gems of Samarkand, or those perfumes of
Syria the frequent allusion to which in their legends encrusts them,
like the walls of the cavern of Ala-ed-din, with fairy jewels. But
words were jewels to the Arab. When Al-Mamoun, the son of
Haroun-al-Raschid, dictated terms of peace to the Greek emperor Michael
the Stammerer, the tribute which he demanded from his conquered enemy
was a collection of manuscripts of the most famous Greek authors. A
fitting indemnity to be demanded by the prince of a nation of
poets!</p>
<p>But conquered Spain was more especially the seat and centre of
Arabian literature and learning. Cordova, Granada,
Seville&mdash;indeed, all the cities of the Peninsula occupied by the
Saracens&mdash;rivalled one another in the celebrity of their schools
and colleges, their libraries, and other places of resort for the
scholar and man of letters. The seventy libraries of Moorish Spain
which flourished in the twelfth century put to shame the dark ignorance
of Europe, which in time rather from the Arab than from fallen Rome won
back its enlightenment. Arabic became not only the literary but the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>colloquial tongue of thousands of Spaniards who
dwelt in the south under Moorish rule. Even the canons of the Church
were translated into Arabic, about the middle of the eighth century,
for the use of those numerous Christians who knew no other language.
The colleges and universities founded by Abderahman and his successors
were frequented by crowds of European scholars. Thus the learning and
the philosophy if not the poetry of the Saracens were enabled to lay
their imprint deeply upon plastic Europe. If, however, we inquire more
closely into the local origins of this surprising enlightenment, we
shall find it owing even more to the native Jews of Spain than to the
Moors themselves.</p>
<p>The phase of Arabian culture with which we are most nearly concerned
is its poetic achievement, and the ultimate influence which it brought
to bear upon Spanish literary composition. The poetry of this richly
endowed and imaginative people had at the period of their entrance into
Spain arrived, perhaps, at the apogee of splendour. Its warm and
luxuriant genius was wholly antagonistic to the more restrained and
disciplined verse of Greece and Rome, which it regarded as cold,
formal, and quite unworthy of translation. It surpassed in bold and
extravagant hyperbole, fantastic imagery, and emotional appeal. The
Arab poet heaped metaphor upon metaphor. He was incapable of seeing
that that which was intrinsically beautiful in itself might appear
superfluous and lacking in taste when combined with equally graceful
but discordant elements. Many critics hasten to reassure us regarding
his judgment and discrimination. But even a slight acquaintance with
Arabic literature will show that they have been carried <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>away by
their prejudice in favour of the subject on which they wrote. In the
garden of the Arabian poet every flower is a jewel, every plot is a
silken carpet, tapestried with the intricate patterns of the weavers of
Persia, and every maiden is a houri, each of whose physical attributes
becomes in turn the subject of a glowing quatrain. The constant
employment of synonym and superlative, the extravagance of amorous
emotion, and the frequent absence of all message, of that large
utterance in which the poets of the West have indicated to the
generation they served how it might best grapple with problems of mind
and soul&mdash;these were the weaknesses of the Arab singers. They made
apophthegm take the place of message. They were unaware that the fabric
of poetry is not only a palace of pleasure, but a great academy of the
soul.</p>
<p>The true love of nature, too, seems to have been as much lacking in
the Arab as in the Greek and the Roman. He enamelled his theme with the
meticulous care of a jeweller. Not content with painting the lily, he
burnished it until it seemed a product of the goldsmith&rsquo;s art. To
him nature was a thing not only to be improved upon, but to be
surpassed, a mine of gems in the rough, to be patiently polished.</p>
<p>But it would be wrong to refuse to the imaginative literature of the
Arabs a high place among the world&rsquo;s achievements, and we must
regret that, for causes into which we cannot enter here, opportunities
for development and discipline were not vouchsafed it. As we read the
history of the Arabian states with their highly developed civilization,
their thronged academies, and their far-flung dominions, reaching from
Central Asia to the western gates of the Mediterranean, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>turn, to-day to the scenes where such things
flourished, we must indeed be unimaginative if we fail to be impressed
by the universal wreck and ruin to which these regions have been
exposed. The great, emulous, and spirited race which conquered and
governed them gathered the world to its doors, and the rude peoples of
Europe clustered about its knees to listen to the magical tales of
unfolding science which fell from its lips. From the desert it came,
and to the desert it has returned.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1300" class="main">Moorish &lsquo;Fashion&rsquo; in
Spanish Romance</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of Moorish grandeur of thought and luxuriance of
emotion we find little in Spanish literature, at least until the
beginning of the fifteenth century. Its note is distinctively, nay
almost aggressively, <i>European</i>, as will be readily understood
from the circumstances of its origin.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e1307src" href="#xd19e1307" name="xd19e1307src">23</a> But it
would seem that with the Castilian occupation of the Moorish parts of
Spain the atmosphere which the Saracen had left behind him powerfully
affected the Spaniard, who appears to have cast a halo of romance round
the character of his ancient foe, with whose civilization, as expressed
in its outward manifestations of architecture and artifact, he could
scarcely have failed to be deeply impressed. If our conclusions are
well founded it would appear that about the era alluded to a Moorish
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>&rsquo;fashion&rsquo; set in in Spanish
literature, just as did an Oriental craze in the England of Byron and
Moore, when English people began to travel in the Levantine countries.
But this fashion was in great measure pseudo-Saracenic, unaffected by
literary models and derived indirectly more from atmosphere and art
than directly from men or books. Long before the fifteenth century,
however, with its rather artificial mania for everything Moresque, the
Arab spirit had been at work upon Spanish literature, although in a
feeble and unconscious manner. Spanish literary <i>forms</i>, whether
in verse or prose, owe absolutely nothing to it, and especially is this
the case in regard to the assonance which characterizes Castilian
poetry, a prosodic device found in the verse of all Romance tongues at
an early period. The Moors, however, seem to have sophisticated, if
they did not write, the ballads of the Hispano-Moorish frontiers,
especially those which have reference to the loss of Alhamia. In any
case these are founded upon Moorish legends. Certain metrical pedants,
like the Marquis de Santillana, toyed with Arabic verse-forms as
Swinburne did with the French rondeau or Dobson with the ballade, or as
the dry-as-dusts of our universities with Greek hexameters, neglecting
for the alien and recondite the infinite possibilities of their
mother-tongue. These preciosities, to which many men of letters in all
ages have been addicted, had no more effect upon the main stream of
Castilian literature than such attempts ever have upon the literary
output of a country. Some of the popular <i>coplas</i>, or couplets,
however, seem to be direct translations from the Arabic, which is not
surprising when we remember the considerable number of half-breeds to
be found in the Peninsula until the middle of the seventeenth century.
There can be no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>doubt, too, that Arabic was the spoken language of
thousands of Christians in Southern Spain. But that it had a determined
opponent in the native Spanish is becoming more and more clear&mdash;an
opponent which it found as merciless as the Moor found the
Spaniard.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1321src" href="#xd19e1321" name=
"xd19e1321src">24</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the best measure of the decline of Arabic as a spoken
language in Spain is the fact that the authors of many romances declare
them to be mere translations from the Arabic&mdash;usually the writings
of Moorish magicians or astrologers. These pretensions are easily
refuted by means of internal evidence. But regarding the question
broadly and sanely, Spanish literature could no more remain unaffected
by Arab influence than could Spanish music, architecture, or
handicrafts. All such influences, however, were undoubtedly late, and,
as regards the romances, were much more &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; than
&lsquo;material.&rsquo; Christian Spain had held off the Saracen for
eight hundred years, and when at last she consented to drink out of the
Saracen cup she filled it with her own wine. But the strange liquor
which had brimmed it before left behind it the mysterious odours and
scents of the Orient, faint, yet unmistakable.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1347" class="main">The Type of Spanish Romance</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The type of Spanish romance at its best is that in
which the spirit of wonder is mingled with the spirit of chivalry. Old
Spain, with her glorious ideas of honour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>her finely wrought sense
of chivalry, and her birthright of imagination, provided almost a
natural crucible for the admixture of the elements of romance. Every
circumstance of climate and environment assisted and fostered the
illusions with which Spanish story teemed, and above all there was a
more practical interest in the life chivalric in Spain than, perhaps,
in any other country in Europe. The Spaniard carried the insignia of
chivalry more properly than Frenchman or Englishman. It was his natural
apparel, and he brought to its wearing a dignity, a gravity, and a
consciousness of fitness unsurpassed. If he degenerated into a Quixote
it was because of the whole-hearted seriousness with which he had
embraced the knightly life. He was certainly the first to laugh when he
found that his manners, like his mail, had become obsolete. But even
the sound of that laughter is knightly, and the book which aroused it
has surely won at least as many hearts for romanticism as ever it
disillusioned.</p>
<p>The history of Spanish conquest is a chronicle of champions, of
warriors almost superhuman in ambition and endurance, mighty carvers of
kingdoms, great remodellers of the world&rsquo;s chart, who, backed by
a handful of lances, and whether in Valencia, Mexico, Italy, or
Araucan, surpassed the fabulous deeds of Amadis or Palmerin. In a later
day the iron land of Castile was to send forth iron men who were to
carry her banners across an immensity of ocean to the uttermost parts
of the earth. What inspired them to live and die in harness surrounded
by dangers more formidable than the enchantments of malevolent
sorcerers or than ever confronted knights-errant in the quest of
mysterious castles? What heartened them in an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>existence of continuous strife, privation, and
menace? Can we doubt that the hero-tales of their native land magically
moved and inspired them&mdash;that when going into battle the exploits
of the heroes of romance rang in their ears like a fanfare from the
trumpets of heralds at a tournament?</p>

<p class="first">The French origin of the <i>cantares de gesta</i> has
already been alluded to. Their very name, indeed, bespeaks a Gallic
source. But in justice to the national genius of Spain we trust that it
has been made abundantly clear that the <i>cantares</i> speedily cast
off the northern mode and robed themselves in Castilian garb. Some
lands possess an individuality so powerful, a capacity for absorption
and transmutation so exceptional, that all things, both physical and
spiritual, which invade their borders become transfigured and speedily
metamorphosed to suit their new environment. Of this magic of
transformation Spain, with Egypt and America, seems to hold the
especial secret. But transfigure the <i lang="fr">chansons</i> of
France as she might, the mould whence they came is apparent to those
who are cognisant of their type and machinery. Nor could the character
of their composers and professors be substantially altered, so that we
must not be surprised to find in Spain the <i lang=
"fr">trouv&egrave;res</i> and <i lang="fr">jongleurs</i> of France as
<i lang="es">trovadores</i> and <i lang="es">juglares</i>. The <i lang=
"es">trovador</i> was the poet, the author, the <i>juglar</i> merely
the singer or declaimer, although no very hard-and-fast line was drawn
betwixt them. Some <i lang="es">juglares</i> of more than ordinary
distinction were also the authors of the <i lang="es">cantares</i> they
sang, while an unsuccessful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span><i lang="es">trovador</i> might be
forced to chant the verses of others. Instrumentalists or accompanists
were known as <i lang="es">juglares de p&eacute;&ntilde;ola</i> in
contradistinction to the reciters or singers, <i lang="es">juglares de
boca</i>.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the <i lang="es">juglar</i>, indeed, was left the
final form of the <i lang="es">cantar</i>, for he would shape and shear
it, add to or suppress, as his instinct told him the taste of his
audience demanded. Not infrequently he would try to pour the wine of a
<i lang="es">cantar</i> into the bottle of a popular air, and if it
overflowed and was spilt, so much the worse for the <i lang=
"es">cantar</i>. Frequently he was accompanied not only by an
instrumentalist, but by a <i lang="es">remendador</i>, or mimic, who
illustrated his tale in dumb show. These sons of the gay science were
notoriously careless of their means of livelihood, and lived a
hand-to-mouth existence. A crust of bread and a cup of wine sufficed
them when silver was scarce. Unsullied by the lust of hire, they
journeyed from hall to hall, from castle to castle, unmindful of all
but their mission&mdash;to soothe the asperities of a barbarous
age.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Our long-dead brothers of the roundelay,</p>
<p class="line">Whose meed was wine, who held that praise was pay,</p>
<p class="line">Hearten ye by their lives, ye singers of to-day!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But this simple state did not last. As the taste for
the <i lang="es">cantares</i> grew, the <i lang="es">trovadores</i> and
their satellites, after the manner of mankind, became clamorous for the
desirable things of life, making the age-long plea of the artist that
the outward insignia of beauty are his very birthright, and forgetting
how fatal it is to</p>

<p>These &ldquo;spirits from beyond the moon&rdquo; did not, alas!
&ldquo;refuse the boon.&rdquo; Kings, infantes, and peers indulged the
<i lang="es">trovador</i> out of full purses, flattered him by
imitating his art and his life, and even enrolled themselves in his
brotherhood. Few men of genius are so constituted as to be able to
control altogether a natural hauteur and superiority. In these early
days poetical arrogance seems to have been as unchecked as military
boastfulness, and the <i lang="es">trovadores</i>, pampered and
f&ecirc;ted by prince and noble, at length grew insufferable in their
insolence and rapacity. The land swarmed with singers, real and
pretended, the manner of whose lives became a scandal, even in a day
when scandal was cheap. The public grew weary of the repetition of the
<i lang="es">cantares</i> and the harping on a single string. It became
fashionable to read romances instead of listening to them, and
eventually we see the <i lang="es">juglares</i> footing it on the
highways of Spain, and declaiming at street-corners in a state of
mendicancy more pitiable by far than their old indigent yet dignified
conditions.</p>

<p>Few of the ancient <i lang="es">cantares</i> of Spain have survived,
in contradistinction to the hundred or more <i lang="es">chansons</i>
that France can show. But what remains of them suffices to distinguish
their type with sufficient clearness. As has been indicated, we owe our
knowledge of more than one of them to the circumstance that they became
embedded in the ancient chronicles of Spain. An excellent illustration
of this process of literary embalming is provided by the manner in
which the <i lang="es">cantar</i> of Bernaldo de Carpio has become
encrusted in the rather dreary mass of the <i>General Chronicle of
Spain</i> which was compiled by King Alfonso the Wise (<i>c.</i> 1260),
in which it will be found in the seventh and twelfth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>chapters
of the third part. The poet-king states that he has founded his history
of Bernaldo upon &ldquo;old lays,&rdquo; and in the spirit as well as
the form of his account of the legendary champion we can trace the
influence of the <i lang="es">cantar</i>.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1524" class="main">The Story of Bernaldo de Carpio</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Young Bernaldo de Carpio, when he arrived at manhood,
was, like many another hero of romance, unaware that he was of
illustrious parentage, for his mother was a sister of Don Alfonso of
Castile, and had wed in secret the brave and noble Count de Sandias de
Salda&ntilde;a. King Alfonso, bitterly offended that his sister should
mate with one who was her inferior in rank, cast the Count into prison,
where he caused him to be deprived of sight, and immured the princess
in a cloister. Their son Bernaldo, however, he reared with care. While
still a youth, Bernaldo rendered his uncle important services, but when
he learned that his father languished in prison a great melancholy
settled upon him, and he cared no more for the things that had once
delighted him. Instead of mingling in the tourney or the dance, he put
on deep mourning, and at last presented himself before King Alfonso and
beseeched him to set his father at liberty.</p>
<p>Now Alfonso was greatly troubled when he knew that Bernaldo was
aware of his lineage and of his father&rsquo;s imprisonment, but his
hatred for the man who had won his sister was greater than his love for
his nephew. At first he made no reply, but sat plucking at his beard,
so taken aback was he. But kings are not often at a loss, and Alfonso,
thinking to brush the matter aside by brusque words, frowned, and said
sternly: &ldquo;Bernaldo, as you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52"
href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>love me, speak no more of this
matter. I swear to you that never in all the days of my life shall your
father leave his prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Bernaldo, &ldquo;you are my king and may
do whatsoever you shall hold for good, but I pray God that He will
change your heart in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Alfonso had no son of his own, and in an ill moment proposed
that Charlemagne, the mighty Emperor of the Franks, should be regarded
as his successor. But his nobles remonstrated against his choice, and
refused to receive a Frank as heir to the throne of Christian Spain.
Charlemagne, learning of Alfonso&rsquo;s proposal, prepared to invade
Spain on the pretext of expelling the Moors, but Alfonso, repenting of
his intention to leave the crown to a foreigner, rallied his forces
around him and allied himself with the Saracens. A battle, fierce and
sustained, took place in the Pass of Roncesvalles, in which the Franks
were signally defeated, chiefly by the address of Bernaldo, who slew
the famous champion Roland with his own hand.</p>
<p>These and the other services of Bernaldo King Alfonso endeavoured to
reward. But neither gift nor guerdon would young Bernaldo receive at
his hands, save only the freedom of his father. Again and again did the
King promise to fulfil his request, but as often found an excuse for
breaking his word, until at last Bernaldo, in bitter disappointment,
renounced his allegiance and declared war against his treacherous
uncle. The King, in dread of his nephew&rsquo;s popularity and warlike
ability, at last had recourse to a stratagem of the most dastardly
kind. He assured Bernaldo of his father&rsquo;s release if he would
agree to the surrender of the great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"
href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>castle of Carpio. The young
champion immediately gave up its keys in person, and eagerly requested
that his father might at once be restored to him. The treacherous
Alfonso in answer pointed to a group of horsemen who approached at a
gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder, Bernaldo, is thy father,&rdquo; he said mockingly.
&ldquo;Go and embrace him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bernaldo,&rdquo; says the chronicle, &ldquo;went toward him
and kissed his hand. But when he found it cold and saw that all his
colour was black, he knew that he was dead; and with the grief he had
from it he began to cry aloud and to make great moan, saying:
&lsquo;Alas! Count Sandias, in an evil hour was I born, for never was
man so lost as I am now for you; for since you are dead and my castle
is gone, I know no counsel by which I may do aught.&rsquo;&rdquo; Some
say in their <i>cantares de gesta</i> that the King then said:
&ldquo;Bernaldo, now is not the time for much talking, and therefore I
bid you go straightway forth from my land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Broken-hearted and utterly crushed by this final blow to his hopes,
Bernaldo turned his horse&rsquo;s head and rode slowly away. And from
that day his banner was not seen in Christian Spain, nor the echoes of
his horn heard among her hills. Hopeless and desperate, he took service
with the Moors. But his name lives in the romances and ballads of his
native country as that of a great champion foully wronged by the
treachery of an unjust and revengeful King.</p>
<p>Although the <i>cantares</i> of Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez and
the Children of Lara also lie embedded in the chronicles, I have
preferred to deal with them in the chapter on the ballads, the form in
which they are undoubtedly best known. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But by far the most complete and characteristic of the
<i>cantares de gesta</i> is the celebrated <i lang="es">Poema del
Cid</i>, the title which has become attached to it in default of all
knowledge of its original designation. That it is a <i>cantar</i> must
be plain to all who possess even a slight familiarity with the <i lang=
"fr">chansons de gestes</i> of France. Like many of the <i>chansons</i>
heroes, the Cid experiences royal ingratitude, and is later taken back
into favour. The stock phrases of the <i>chansons</i>, too, are
constantly to be met with in the poem, and the atmosphere of boastful
herohood arising from its pages strengthens the resemblance. There is
also pretty clear proof that the author of the <i>Poema</i> had read or
heard the <i>Chanson de Roland</i>. This is not to say that he
practised the vile art of adaptation or the viler art of paraphrase, or
in any way filched from the mighty epic of Roncesvalles. But
superficial borrowings of incident appear, which are, however, amply
redeemed by originality of treatment and inspiration. The thought and
expression are profoundly national; nor does the language exhibit
French influence, save, as has been said, in the matter of well-worn
expressions, the <i>clich&eacute;s</i> of medieval epic.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1589" class="main">Its Only Manuscript</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But one manuscript of the <i>Poema del Cid</i> is
known, the handiwork of a certain Per or Pedro the Abbot. About the
third quarter of the eighteenth century, Sanchez, the royal librarian,
was led to suspect through certain bibliographical references that such
a manuscript might exist in the neighbourhood of Bivar, the birthplace
of the hero of the poem, and he succeeded in unearthing it in that
village. The date at the end is given as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>Mille CCXLV, and
authorities are not agreed as to its significance, some holding that a
vacant space showing an erasure after the second C is intentional, and
that it should read 1245 (1207 new style). Others believe that 1307 is
the true date of the MS. However that may be, the poem itself is
referred to a period not earlier than the middle of the twelfth nor
later than the middle of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>As we possess it, the manuscript is in a rather mutilated and
damaged condition. The commencement and title are lost, a page in the
middle is missing, and the end has been sadly patched by an unskilful
hand. Sanchez states, in his <i lang="es">Poes&iacute;as Castellanas
anteriores al Siglo XV</i> (1779&ndash;90) that he had seen a copy made
in 1596 which showed that the MS. had the same deficiencies then as
now.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1604" class="main">Its Authorship Unknown</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The personality of the author of the <i>Poema del
Cid</i> will probably for ever remain unknown. He may have been a
churchman, as Ormsby suggests, but I am inclined to the opinion that he
was a professional <i>trovador</i>. The <i>trouv&egrave;res</i>, rather
than ecclesiastics, were responsible for such works in France, and why
not the <i>trovadores</i> in Spain?<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1620src"
href="#xd19e1620" name="xd19e1620src">1</a> That the writer lived near
the time of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>events he celebrated is plain, probably about half
a century after the Cid sheathed his famous sword Colada for the last
time. On the ground of various local allusions in the poem he has been
claimed as a native of the Valle de Arbujuelo and as a monk of the
monastery of Carde&ntilde;a, near Burgos. But these surmises have
nothing but textual references to recommend them, and are only a little
more probable than that which would make him an Asturian because he
does not employ the diphthong <i>ue</i>. We have good grounds, however,
for the assumption that he was at least a Castilian, and these are to
be found in his fierce political animus against the kingdom of Leon and
all that pertained to it. That Pedro the Abbot was merely a copyist is
clear from his mishandling of the manuscript; for though we have to
thank him for the preservation of the <i>Poema</i>, our gratitude is
dashed with irritation at the manner in which he has passed it on to
us, for his copy is replete with vain repetitions, he frequently runs
two lines into one, and occasionally even transfers the matter of one
line to another in his haste to be free of his task.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1663" class="main">Other Cantares of the Cid</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That other <i lang="es">cantares</i> relating to the
Cid existed is positively known through the researches of Se&ntilde;or
Don Ram&oacute;n Men&eacute;ndez Pidal, who has demonstrated that one
of them was used in the most ancient version of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span><i lang=
"es">Cr&oacute;nica General</i>, of which three recensions evidently
existed at different periods, and it is now clear that the passage in

as was formerly believed.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e1677src" href=
"#xd19e1677" name="xd19e1677src">2</a> The passages on the Cid in the
second version of the <i lang="es">Cr&oacute;nica</i> are also derived
from still another <i lang="es">cantar</i> on the popular hero, known
as the <i lang="es">Cr&oacute;nica Rimada</i>,<a class="noteref" id=

<i>m&eacute;lange</i> of several lost <i lang="es">cantares</i>
relating to the Cid, as well as to other Spanish traditions. This

<h3 id="xd19e1716" class="main">Metre of the &ldquo;Poema del
Cid&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It would certainly seem as if, like all <i lang=
"es">cantares</i>, the poem had been especially written for public
recitation. The expression &ldquo;<i lang="es">O
se&ntilde;ores</i>,&rdquo; encountered in places, may be taken as the
equivalent of the English &ldquo;Listen, lordings,&rdquo; of such
frequent occurrence in our own lays and romances, which was intended to
appeal to the attention or spur the flagging interest of a medieval
audience. The metre in which the poem is written is almost as unequal
as its poetic quality. The prevailing line is the Alexandrine or
fourteen-syllabled verse, but some lines run far over this average,
while others are truncated in barbarous fashion, probably through the
inattention or haste of the copyist.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e1726src" href="#xd19e1726" name="xd19e1726src">4</a> It seems to
me <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>that the <i>Poema</i>, although of the highest
merit in many of its finest passages, has received the most extravagant
eulogy, and I suspect that many of the English critics who descant so
glibly upon its excellences have never perused it in its entirety.
Considerable tracts of it are of the most pedestrian description, and
in places it descends to a doggerel which recalls the metrical
barbarities of the pantomime. But when the war-trump gives him the key
it arouses the singer as it arouses Scott&mdash;the parallel is an apt
and almost exact one&mdash;and it is a mighty orchestra indeed which
breaks upon our ears. The lines surge and swell in true Homeric
tempest-sound, and as we listen to the crash of Castilian spears upon
the Moorish ranks we are reminded of those sounding lines in
Swinburne&rsquo;s <i>Erechtheus</i> beginning:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">With a trampling of drenched, red hoofs and an
earthquake of men that meet,</p>
<p class="line">Strong war sets hand to the scythe, and the furrows
take fire from his feet.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the music of the singer of the <i>Poema</i> does
not depend upon reverberative effect alone. His is the true music of
battle, burning the blood with keenest fire, and he has no need to rely
solely upon the gallop of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=

admiration, as does the English poet.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1762" class="main">The Poem Opens</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The opening of the <i>Poema del Cid</i>, as we possess
it, is indeed sufficiently striking and dramatic to console us for the
loss of the original commencement. The great commander, banished
(<i>c.</i> 1088) by royal order from the house of his father through
the treachery of the Leonese party at the Court of King Alfonso, rides
away disconsolately from the broken gates of his castle. A fairly
accurate translation of this fine passage might read as follows:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He turns to see the ruined hold, the tears fall thick
and fast,</p>
<p class="line">The empty chests, the broken gates, all open to the
blast.</p>
<p class="line">Sans raiment are the wardrobes, reft of mantle and of
vair,</p>
<p class="line">The empty hollow of the hall of tapestry is bare.</p>
<p class="line">No feather in the falconry, no hawk to come to
hand,</p>
<p class="line">A noble beggar must the Cid renounce his fathers&rsquo;
land.</p>
<p class="line">He sighed, but as a warrior sighs. &ldquo;Now I shall
not repine.</p>
<p class="line">All praise to Thee, our Father, for Thy grace to me and
mine.</p>
<p class="line">The slanderous tongue, the lying tale, have wrought my
wreck to-day,</p>
<p class="line">But Thou in Thy good time, O Lord, the debt wilt sure
repay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">As they rode out of Bivar flew a raven to the
right,</p>
<p class="line">By Burgos as they bridled the bird was still in
sight.</p>
<p class="line">The Cid he shrugged his shoulders as the omen he
espied;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Greetings, Cousin Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez, we are
exiles now,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p class="line">The sixty lances of the Cid rode clattering through the
town;</p>
<p class="line">From casement and from turret-top the burgher-folk
looked down.</p>
<p class="line">Sore were their hearts and salt their eyen as Roderick
rode by;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;There goes a worthy vassal who has known bad
mastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">And many a roof that night had sheltered Roderick and
his band</p>
<p class="line">But for the dread in Burgos of Alfonso&rsquo;s heavy
hand.</p>
<p class="line">The missive broad with kingly seals had run throughout
the town:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Who aids the Cid in banishment, his house shall
be cast down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">So as the train rode through the streets each eye was
turned aside,</p>
<p class="line">All silent was the town-house where the Cid was wont to
bide; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Both lock and bar were on the gates, he might not enter
there.</p>
<p class="line">Then from a casement spoke a maid who had the house in
care:</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;My lord Don Roderick, who took the sword in
happy hour,</p>
<p class="line">The King hath sent a letter broad to ban from hall and
bower</p>
<p class="line">Both thee and all thy company, &rsquo;tis doom to
shelter one;</p>
<p class="line">Never again who aids thee shall his eyes look on the
sun.</p>
<p class="line">Now go, and Godd&euml;s help with thee, thy pity we
implore;</p>
<p class="line">In all broad Spain thou canst not lack, O Cid
Camp&eacute;ador.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Finding no place to lay their heads within the town,
the Cid with his men rode disconsolately to the plain of Glera, to the
east of Burgos, where he pitched his tents on the banks of the river
Arlanzon. To him came Martin Antolinez, one of his former vassals, who
brought food and wine for all his train and strove to comfort him. Not
a <i>maravedi</i> had the Cid, and how to furnish his men with arms and
food he knew not. But he and Antolinez took counsel together, and hit
upon a plan by which they hoped to procure the necessary sinews of war.
Taking two large chests, they covered them with red leather and studded
them with gilt nails, so that they made a brave outward show. Then they
filled the chests with sand from the river-banks and locked them
securely.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Martin Antolinez,&rdquo; said the Cid,
&ldquo;thou art a true man and a good vassal. Go thou to the Jews
Raquel and Vidas, and tell them I have much treasure which I desire to
leave with them since it is too weighty to carry along with me. Pledge
thou these chests with them for what may seem reasonable. I call God
and all His saints to witness that I do this thing because I am driven
to extremity and for the sake of those who depend upon me.&rdquo;
Antolinez, rather fearful of his mission, sought out the Jews Raquel
and Vidas where they counted out their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>wealth and their profits.
He told them that the Cid had levied much tribute which he found it
impossible to carry with him, and that he would pledge this with them
if they would lend him a reasonable sum upon it. But he stipulated that
they must solemnly bind themselves not to open the chests for a year to
come. The Jews took counsel together, and consented to hide the chests
and not to look upon their contents for a year at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell us,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;what sum will content
the Cid, and what interest will he give us for the year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needy men gather to my lord the Cid from all sides,&rdquo;
replied Antolinez. &ldquo;He will require at least six hundred
marks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will willingly give that sum,&rdquo; said Raquel and
Vidas, &ldquo;for the treasure of such a great lord as the Cid must
indeed be immense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasten then,&rdquo; said Antolinez, &ldquo;for night
approaches, and my lord the Cid is under decree of banishment to quit
Castile at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the Jews, after the manner of their kind.
&ldquo;Business is not done thus, but by first taking and then
giving.&rdquo; They then requested to be taken to where the Cid lay,
and having greeted him, paid over the sum agreed upon. They were
surprised and delighted at the weight of the chests, and departed well
satisfied, giving Antolinez a present or commission of thirty golden
marks for the share he had taken in the business.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e1864" class="main">Donna Ximena</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When they had gone the Cid struck his camp and
galloped through the night to the monastery of San Pedro de
Carde&ntilde;a, where his lady, Donna Ximena, and his two young
daughters lay. He found them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href=
"#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>deeply engaged in prayer for his
welfare, and they received him with heartfelt expressions of joy.
Taking the Abbot aside, the Cid explained to him that he was about to
fare forth on adventure in the country of the Moors, and tendered him
such a sum as would provide for the maintenance of Donna Ximena and her
daughters until his return, as well as a goodly bounty for the
convent&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>By this time tidings of the Cid&rsquo;s banishment had gone through
the land broadcast, and so great was the fame of his prowess that
cavaliers from near and far flocked to his banner. When he put foot in
stirrup at the bridge of Arlanza a hundred and fifty gentlemen had
assembled to follow his fortunes. The parting with his wife and
daughters presents a poignant picture of leave-taking:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Sharp as the pain when finger-nails are wrenched from
off the hand,</p>
<p class="line">So felt the Cid this agony, but turned him to his
band,</p>
<p class="line">And vaulted in the saddle, and forth led his menie,</p>
<p class="line">But ever and anon he turned his streaming eyes to
see</p>
<p class="line">Dear faces he might see no more, till blunt Minaya,
irked</p>
<p class="line">To see the yearning and regret that on his heartstrings
worked,</p>
<p class="line">Cried out, &ldquo;O born in happy hour,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e1887src" href="#xd19e1887" name="xd19e1887src">5</a>
let not thy soul be sad:</p>
<p class="line">The heart of knight on venture bound should never but
be glad.</p>
<p class="line">The heavy sorrow of to-day will prove to-morrow&rsquo;s
joy.</p>
<p class="line">What grief can bide the trumpets&rsquo; sound, what woe
the battle&rsquo;s ploy?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Giving rein to their steeds, they galloped forth of
the bounds of Christian Spain and, crossing the river Duero on rafts,
stood upon Moorish soil. Far to the west they could see the slender
minarets of the Saracen city of Ahilon glittering in the high sun of
noon, emblematic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>of the rich treasure they had come to win in the
land of the paynim. At Higeruela still more good lances rallied to the
Cid&rsquo;s banners, border men to whom the foray was a holiday and the
breaking of spears the sweetest music. As he slept that night the Cid
dreamed that the Archangel Gabriel appeared to him and said:
&ldquo;Mount, O Cid Campeador, mount and ride. Thy cause is just.
Whilst thou livest thou shalt prosper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With three hundred lances behind him, the Cid rode into the land of
the Moors. He lay in ambush while Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez and other knights
made a foray toward Alcal&aacute;. In their absence the Cid observed
that the men of Castijon, a Moorish town hard by, came out of the place
to work in the fields, leaving the gates open. He and his men made a
dash at the gates, slew the handful of heathens who guarded them, and
took the town without striking a score of blows. The men were well
content at the treasure of gold and silver they found in the quaint
Moorish houses. But they were merciful to the inhabitants, of whom they
made servitors rather than slaves.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e1903" class="main">The Taking of Alcocer</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After they had rested at Castijon, the Cid and his
array rode down the valley of the Henares, passing by way of Alhamia to
Bubierca and Ateca, and as he was in unknown country, and environed
round by hosts of enemies, he took up a position upon a &ldquo;round
hill&rdquo; near the strong Saracen city of Alcocer, to which he set
siege. But the place was well guarded, and he saw that if he were to
penetrate its defences it must be by stratagem and not by fighting
alone. So one morning, after he had beleaguered Alcocer for full
fifteen weeks, he withdrew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>his men as if retreating in disgust,
leaving but one pavilion behind him. When the Moors beheld his
withdrawal they exulted, and in their eagerness to see what spoil the
solitary tent might contain they rushed out of the town, leaving the
gates open and unguarded. Now when the Cid saw that there was a wide
space between the Moors and the gates of Alcocer, he ordered his men to
turn and fall upon the excited rabble of Saracens. Small need had he to
ask them to smite the paynim. Dashing among the dense crowd with
levelled lances, the cavaliers of Castile did fearful execution. The
wretched Moors, taken completely by surprise, fled wildly in all
directions, and soon the plain was littered with white-robed corpses.
Meanwhile the Cid himself, with a few trusted followers, galloped to
the gates and secured them, so that with, much triumph the Spaniards
entered Alcocer. As before, the Campeador was merciful to such of the
Moors as made full surrender, saying: &ldquo;We cannot sell them, and
we shall gain nothing by cutting off their heads. Let us make them
rather serve us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd19e1910width" id="p064"><img src="images/p064.jpg"
alt="The Cid in Battle" width="501" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">The Cid in Battle</p>
</div>
<p>The Saracens of the neighbouring towns of Ateca and Zerrel were
aghast at the manner in which Alcocer had been taken, and sent word to
the Moorish King of Valencia how one called Roderigo Diaz of Bivar, a
Castilian outlaw, had come into their land to spoil it, and had already
taken the strong city of Alcocer. When King Tamin of Valencia heard
these tidings he was greatly wroth, and sent an army of three thousand
well-appointed men against the Campeador. In his anger he charged his
captains that they should take this Spanish renegade alive, and bring
him where justice might be done upon him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Cid knew nothing of the coming of this host, and one morning his
sentinels, pacing the walls of Alcocer, were surprised to see the
surrounding country alive with Moorish scouts, flitting from point to
point upon their active jennets, and shaking their <span class="corr"
id="xd19e1919" title="Source: scimetars">scimitars</span> in menace.
His own outposts soon brought in word that he was surrounded, and his
knights and men-at-arms clamoured to be led forth to do battle with the
infidels. But the Cid was old in Moorish warfare, and denied them for
the moment. For days the enemy paraded around the walls of Alcocer. But
the Cid, with three hundred men, knew well the folly of attacking three
thousand, and bided his time.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At last the Moors succeeded in cutting off the
water-supply of Alcocer. Provisions, too, were running low, and the Cid
saw clearly that such a desperate situation demanded a desperate
remedy. Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez, ever panting for the fight like a war-horse
that hears the trumpet, urged an immediate sally in force, and the Cid,
knowing the high spirit of his men, consented. First he sent all the
Moors out of the city and looked to its defences. Then, leaving but two
men to guard the gate, he marshalled his array and issued forth from
Alcocer with dressed ranks and in strict order of battle. And here
prose must once more give place to verse.<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<p class="first">Fierce and sanguinary was the pursuit. The Moorish
rout was complete, and the little Castilian band had lost but fifteen
men. Five hundred Arab horses, heavily caparisoned, each with a
splendid sword at the saddle-bow, fell into the hands of the Cid, who
kept a fifth share for himself, as was the way with the commanders of
such free companies as he led. But greatly desiring to make his peace
with King Alfonso of Castile, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>sent the trusty Alvar
Fa&ntilde;ez to Court with thirty steeds saddled and bridled in the
Moorish fashion.</p>
<p>But the Moors, even with the dust of defeat in their mouths, were
not minded to leave the Cid the freedom of their borders, and seeing
that he would not be able to hold Alcocer for long against their
numbers, he bargained with the Saracens of the neighbouring cities for
the ransom of Alcocer. This they gladly agreed to for three thousand
marks of gold and silver, so, quitting the place, the Campeador pushed
southward, and took up a position on a hill above the district of
Mont&rsquo;real. He laid all the Moorish towns in the neighbourhood
under tribute, remaining in his new encampment full fifteen weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez had journeyed to the Court and had
presented the King with the thirty good steeds taken in battle.
&ldquo;It is yet too soon to take the Cid back into favour,&rdquo; said
Alfonso, &ldquo;but since these horses come from the infidel, I scruple
not to receive them. I pardon thee, Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez, and withdraw my
banishment from thee. But as to the Cid, I say no more than that any
good lance who cares to join him may do so without hindrance from
me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2062" class="main">The War with Raymond Berenger</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now the Count of Barcelona, Raymond Berenger, a
haughty and arrogant lord, conceived the presence of the Cid in a
territory so near his own dominions to be an insult to himself, and in
a high passion he mustered all his forces, Moorish as well as
Christian, so that he might drive the Cid from the lands he held in
tribute. The Campeador, hearing of the advance of this host, sent a
courteous message to Count Raymond, assuring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>him of
pacific intentions toward himself. But the Count felt that his personal
dignity had been offended, and refused to receive the messenger.</p>
<p>When the Cid beheld the army of Raymond marching against his
position on the heights of Mont&rsquo;real, he knew that his overtures
for peace had been in vain, and, dressing his ranks for the fierce
combat that he knew must follow, took up a position upon the plain
suitable for cavalry. The lightly armed Moorish horsemen of
Berenger&rsquo;s host rushed precipitately to the attack, but were
easily routed by the Castilian cavaliers. The Count&rsquo;s Frankish
men-at-arms, a band of skilful and warlike mercenaries, then thundered
down-hill upon the lances of the Cid. The shock was terrific, but brief
was the combat, for the knights of Castile, hardened by constant
warfare, speedily overthrew the Frankish horsemen. The Cid himself
attacked Count Berenger, took him prisoner, and forced him to deliver
up his famous sword Colada, which figures so prominently in the mighty
deeds which follow. A falchion which tradition states is none other
than this celebrated blade, the Spanish Excalibur, is still shown at
the Armeria at Madrid, and all pious lovers of chivalry will gladly
believe that it is the sword taken by the Campeador from the haughty
Berenger, even though the profane point out that its hilt is obviously
of the fifteenth century!</p>
<p>Greatly content were they of the Cid&rsquo;s company with the
victory no less than with the spoil, and a feast worthy of princes was
prepared to celebrate the occasion.</p>
<p>In courtesy the Cid invited the defeated Count Raymond to feast with
him, but he refused the invitation with hauteur, saying that his
capture by outlaws had taken away his appetite. Nettled at this display
of rudeness, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>the Cid told him that he would not see his realms
again until he broke bread and drank wine with him. Three whole days
did the Count refuse to touch all provender, and on the third day the
Cid promised him immediate freedom if he would break his fast. This was
too much for the haughty Berenger, whose hunger now outmatched his
scruples. &ldquo;Powers above!&rdquo; exclaims the poet, &ldquo;with
what gust did he eat! His hands plied so quickly that my Cid<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e2076src" href="#xd19e2076" name="xd19e2076src">7</a>
might not see their play.&rdquo; The Cid then gave him his liberty, and
they parted on good terms.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ride on, ride on, my noble Count, a free Frank
as thou art;</p>
<p class="line">For all the spoil thou leavest me I thank thee from my
heart.</p>
<p class="line">And if to turn the chance of fate against me thou shalt
come,</p>
<p class="line">Right gladly shall I listen for the echoes of thy
drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Nay, Roderick, I leave in peace and peace I
shall maintain;</p>
<p class="line">From me thou sure hast spoil enow to count a
twelvemonth&rsquo;s gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">He drove the spur, but backward glanced, he feared for
treachery;</p>
<p class="line">So black a thought the Cid had harboured not for

<h3 id="xd19e2104" class="main">The Cid Makes War Seaward</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Turning from Huesca and Montalvan, the Cid began to
make war toward the salt sea. His eastward march struck terror to the
hearts of the Moors of Valencia. They took counsel together, and
resolved to send such a host against him as they thought he might not
withstand. But he routed them with such a slaughter that they dared
face him no more. Three years did the Cid <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>war in that country, and
his many conquests there were long to tell. He and his men sat
themselves down in the land as kings, reaped its corn, and ate its
bread. And a great famine came upon the Moors, so that thousands
perished.</p>
<p>Now the Cid sent messengers to Castile and Aragon, who made it known
that all Christians who came to dwell beneath his rule should fare
well. Hearing this, thousands flocked to his banner, and so greatly was
he reinforced that in time he was able to march against Valencia
itself, the capital of the Moors of that country. With all his host he
sat down before that city and beleaguered it. Nine months he environed
it, and in the tenth month the men of Valencia opened the gates and
surrendered the place. Great was the booty of gold and silver and
precious stuffs, so that there fell to his share alone treasure to the
amount of thirty thousand marks, and he grew in greatness so that not
only his own followers but the Moors of Eastern Spain began to look
upon him almost as their rightful lord.</p>
<p>Beholding his puissance, the Moorish King of Seville grew greatly
afraid, and resolved to bring the whole power of his kingdom against
him. Collecting an army of thirty thousand men, he marched against
Valencia. But the Cid encountered him on the banks of the Huerta, and
defeated him so completely that never again was he able to do him
scathe.</p>
<p>The heart of the Cid now began to grow hopeful that his King would
receive him into friendship and confidence once more. And he swore a
great oath that for love of Alfonso he would never let his beard be
shorn. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will my beard be famous among
both Moors and Christians.&rdquo; Once more he sent Alvar <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>Fa&ntilde;ez to Court with the gift of a hundred
splendidly appointed horses of the purest Arab blood, praying that he
might be permitted to bring his wife, Donna Ximena, and their
daughters, to the possessions which he had carved out for himself by
his good sword.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there had come to Valencia from the East a holy man, one
Bishop Don Jerome, who had heard afar of the prowess of the Cid and
longed to cross swords with the infidel. The Cid was well pleased with
him, and founded a bishopric of Valencia for the doughty Christian,
whose one thought was but to spread the worship of God and slay
Saracens.</p>
<p>When Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez reached the Court, he sought audience of
King Alfonso, who was heartened to hear of the deeds of the Campeador,
how he had routed the Moors in five pitched battles, made their lands
subject to the crown of Castile, and erected a bishopric in the heart
of paynimrie, so that he readily granted permission that Donna Ximena
and the ladies Elvira and Sol should go to Valencia. Hearing this,
Count Garcia Ordo&ntilde;ez, of the Leonese party, who had secured the
Cid&rsquo;s banishment and who cordially hated him, was greatly vexed.
But the two Infantes or Princes of Carri&oacute;n, in Leon, seeing how
the Cid grew in power and importance, resolved to ask his daughters in
marriage from the King, but meanwhile kept their counsel.</p>
<p>The time had long passed when the Cid should have discharged his
debt to the Jews Raquel and Vidas, and hearing that Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez
was at Court they came to him and begged that it might be paid.
Fa&ntilde;ez assured them that all should be done as the Cid had
promised, and that only stress of constant warfare had kept his master
from fulfilling his obligation to them. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>were
perfectly satisfied with this assurance, and so greatly had they
trusted the Cid that they had never opened the chests to examine the
nature of the security he had given them.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2127" class="main">The Cid Welcomes his Family</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez now made ready to set out for
Valencia with Donna Ximena and the Cid&rsquo;s daughters, whom he
safely conveyed to their new home. When he heard that they were near at
hand, the Cid, who had only a few days before won his famous steed
Babieca in a skirmish with the Moors, leapt upon the charger&rsquo;s
back, and rode off at a gallop to meet them and welcome them to their
new possessions. Greeting them with much affection, he led them to the
castle, from the towers of which he showed them the lands he had won
for them. And they gave thanks to God for a gift so fair.</p>
<p>Now there was great stirring among the Moors of Africa when they
heard of the deeds of the Cid, and they held it for dishonour that he
should have redeemed so great a part of Spain from their brothers of
the Peninsula. Their king, Yussef, levied a mighty army of fifty
thousand men, and, crossing the seas to Spain, marched upon Valencia,
hoping to regain it for the Crescent. When the Cid heard this, he
exclaimed: &ldquo;I thank God and the blessed Mother that I have my
wife and daughters here. Now shall they see how we do battle with the
Moors and win our bread in the land of the stranger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The host of Yussef soon came in sight, and environed Valencia so
closely that none might enter or leave it, and when the ladies beheld
the great army which surrounded the city they were much afraid. But the
Cid bade them be of good cheer. &ldquo;Hearten ye,&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>said, &ldquo;for, see, marvellous great wealth
comes to us. Here comes a dowry against the marriage of your

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Springing upon Babieca, the Cid led his lances against
the Moors of Africa. Then began a contest great and grim. The Spanish
spears were red that day, and the Cid plied his good blade Colada so
terribly that the Saracens fell before his strokes like corn before the
sickle. He aimed a great blow at King Yussef&rsquo;s helm, but the
Moorish chieftain, avoiding it, gave his horse the rein and galloped
off the field, his dusky host following him in headlong rout. Countless
was the spoil in gold, silver, richly caparisoned horses, shields,
swords, and body-armour.</p>
<p>Too wearied with ceaseless slaughter to give chase, the Cid rode
back to where his wife and daughters had sat watching the progress of
the battle, his dripping sword in his hand. &ldquo;Homage to you,
ladies,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Thus are Moors vanquished on the field
of battle.&rdquo; But ever mindful of his King and liege-lord, he at
once dispatched Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez and Pero Bermuez to Court, with the
tent of King Yussef and two hundred horses with their caparisons.
Greatly pleased was Alfonso. &ldquo;I receive the gift of the Cid
willingly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and may the day of our reconciliation
soon arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Infantes of Carri&oacute;n, seeing that the reputation of the
Cid increased daily, were now fully resolved to ask the daughters of
the Campeador in marriage from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75"
href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>King. Alfonso agreed to enter
into negotiations with the Cid, not only for the hands of his
daughters, but with the idea of effecting a reconciliation with him,
for he was well aware of all the service which the Campeador had done
him. So he sent for Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez and Pero Bermuez and acquainted
them with the offer of the Infantes of Carri&oacute;n, requesting them
to convey it to the Cid without loss of time and assuring him of his
esteem.</p>
<p>The envoys hastened to Valencia and told the Cid how the King had
sent him a gracious message, asking for the hands of his daughters for
the Infantes of Carri&oacute;n. The Cid was right joyful on hearing
this. &ldquo;What the King desires is my pleasure,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;though the Infantes of Carri&oacute;n are haughty, and bad
vassals to the Throne. But be it as God and the King wills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Campeador made great preparations and set out for the
Court, and when the King knew he was approaching he went out to meet
him. And the Cid went on his knees before the King and took the grass
of the field in his teeth to humble himself before his lord. But Don
Alfonso was troubled at the sight, and, raising him, assured him of his
grace and affection, at which the Cid was greatly moved and wept
joyfully. Then the King feasted the Cid bravely, and when the banquet
was at an end asked for the hands of his daughters for the Infantes of
Carri&oacute;n. The Cid made reply that he and his daughters were in
the King&rsquo;s hands and that Alfonso himself might give the damsels
in marriage.</p>

Campeador returned to Valencia with the two Infantes <span class=

Carri&oacute;n. He told his wife and daughters that the marriage was of
the King&rsquo;s making and not of his, as he was not without
misgivings as to the result of the alliance. Nevertheless he made great
preparations, as befitted the importance of such a ceremony with two of
the greatest lords in Spain, and Donna Elvira and Donna Sol were
espoused to the Infantes of Carri&oacute;n in the church of Santa Maria
by the good warrior-bishop Jerome. The wedding celebrations lasted
fifteen days, and the Cid had no reason to be dissatisfied with his
sons-in-law, who bore themselves as gallantly in the lists as in the
dance.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2163" class="main">The Adventure of the Lion</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Infantes of Carri&oacute;n and their wives had
remained in Valencia for about two years when a mishap befell. One day,
during the time of the afternoon siesta, a lion, kept for baiting in
the ring, broke loose from its cage and made its way into the palace.
The Campeador reclined upon a couch asleep, but his dauntless followers
gathered round him to protect him, all except the Infantes of
Carri&oacute;n, one of whom crept beneath the couch on which the Cid
slept, while the other made such speed to quit the palace that he fell
across the beam of a wine-press and rent his robes. The clamour awoke
the Cid, who rose, and, going to where the lion crouched, firmly placed
his hand on the brute&rsquo;s bristling mane and led him back to his
cage. Nor did the lion resist, evidently knowing his master.</p>
<p>The Infantes of Carri&oacute;n, when they knew all danger was past,
came out of hiding, looking so pale and terrified that the hardy
soldiers of the Cid could not restrain their laughter. At this the
haughty northern grandees felt <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77"
href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>deep insult and resentment and
an unmanly feeling of revenge awoke in their hearts.</p>
<p>Within a few days of this incident news reached Valencia that Abu
Bekr, the commander of the armies of the King of Morocco, was marching
upon the city. The Cid and his captains rejoiced at the news, but not
so the Infantes of Carri&oacute;n, who took counsel together as to how
they might avoid the fighting and return to their own territories.</p>
<p>Here a break occurs in the narrative, and from a later passage it is
clear that the missing lines relate to a test of the courage of at
least one of the Infantes, who, stung by an imputation of cowardice,
armed himself and set out to fight a Moor, who, however, put him to
flight. But Pero Bermuez, to save the Cid&rsquo;s feelings, slew the
Saracen and made it appear that the Infante had done so.</p>

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;May the time come when I deserve as much of both

</div>
<p class="first">The line is supposed to be the last in the speech of
Pero Bermuez to the Infante Don Ferrando, who had probably expressed
gratitude to him. The first English author to attempt a translation of
the <i>Poema del Cid</i> was John Hookham Frere, the translator of the
plays of Aristophanes, who was for some years British Minister at
Madrid. He made a conjectural reading of the above line, which he
communicated to the Marquis de la Romana. Some years later, in 1808,
when the Marquis was commanding a body of troops in the French service
in Denmark, Frere was able to accredit a confidential messenger to him,
assuring the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=

message he carried by mention of the amended line, the correction in
which was known only to the Marquis and himself. The circumstance led
to one of the most important movements in the war against Napoleon.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2192" class="main">The Fighting Bishop</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Infantes of Carri&oacute;n, who did not relish the
idea of a protracted struggle with the Moors, resolved to betake
themselves to the security of their own estates at the first
opportunity. But, as if to shame them, the warlike Bishop Jerome
appeared before the Cid armed <i>cap-&agrave;-pie</i> and entreated his
permission to take part in the fighting. The Cid smilingly gave his
assent, and no sooner had he done so than the doughty churchman mounted
a great war-horse and, issuing out of the gates, galloped headlong
against the Saracens. At the first onset he slew two of them outright,
but had the misfortune to break his lance. Nothing daunted, however,
this ardent disciple of the Church militant drew his sword and,
brandishing it about his head like a trained knight-at-arms, flung
himself once more upon the Moorish ranks with all the weight of his
charger. Laying about him left and right, he killed or wounded a
heathen with every blow. But the enemy closed round him, and it would
have gone hard indeed with the fighting bishop had not the Cid, who had
witnessed his gallantry with all a warrior&rsquo;s admiration for the
deeds of another brave man, laid his lance in rest and, setting spurs
to Babieca, plunged into the thickest of the fray. Beneath his terrific
onset the lightly armed Moors gave way in terror. Wheeling, he came at
them again, crashing through their ranks <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>like a tempest, and
dealing death and destruction wherever he went. The Moors wavered,
broke, and fled amain. The whole army of the Cid now bore down upon
them, horse and man, bursting into their camp, breaking the tent-ropes,
and dashing aside the gaudy Eastern pavilions where they had
lodged.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Upon the terror-stricken ranks the horsemen of
Castile</p>
<p class="line">Came thundering down; King Bucar&rsquo;s men the iron

<p class="line">And down to dust the severed arm, the severed
steel-capped head</p>
<p class="line">Fall lifeless, and the charger&rsquo;s hoofs trample
the gory dead.</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ha! stay, King Bucar!&rdquo; cries the Cid.
&ldquo;Now tarry, Moorish lord;</p>
<p class="line">You came to seek me o&rsquo;er the sea, mine is the
peaceful word.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;If peace is in thy naked sword and in thy
charging steed,</p>
<p class="line">Then I would flee it,&rdquo; cried the King, and
spurred his horse to speed.</p>
<p class="line">With hasty stride the King doth ride straight for the
open sea;</p>
<p class="line">Spain&rsquo;s champion is at his side, never again will
he</p>
<p class="line">Know the delights of Algiers&rsquo; halls; Colada

<p class="line">The good blade shears the Moor in twain, down to the

<p class="line">So perished the Algerian lord&mdash;may every Moor die
so!</p>
<p class="line">And thus upon this day of fame the Cid his guerdon
won,</p>
<p class="line">Worth many a purse of minted marks, the noble blade
Tizon!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Riding back from the fray, the Cid espied the Infantes
of Carri&oacute;n and welcomed them. &ldquo;Now that they are brave
will they be welcomed by the brave,&rdquo; he said, rather wistfully,
to Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez. The proud and shallow princes were wrathful when
they overheard this, and the shadow of vengeance once more arose within
their haughty hearts. &ldquo;Let us take our leave of the Cid and
return to Carri&oacute;n,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We have been flouted
and insulted here by these banditti and their leader. On the way home
we shall know how to avenge ourselves upon his daughters.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>With this cowardly purpose they smilingly requested the Campeador to
permit them to depart. Sorrowfully he granted it, and loading them with
presents and bestowing upon them the famous swords Colada and Tizon,
which he had himself taken in battle from the Moors, he requested Feliz
Mu&ntilde;oz, his nephew, to accompany the Infantes and his daughters
to Carri&oacute;n.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2241" class="main">The Infantes&rsquo; Revenge</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Great was the grief of the Cid and Donna Ximena at
parting with the ladies Elvira and Sol, and they were not without some
misgivings. But they charged Feliz Mu&ntilde;oz to keep good watch over
their daughters, and this he promised to do. After journeying for some
days the party had to traverse the great forest of Corpes, where in a
glade they pitched pavilions and spent the night. In the morning the
Infantes sent their suite on ahead, and, taking the saddle-girths from
the horses, beat the unfortunate daughters of the Cid most cruelly. The
wretched ladies begged for death rather than suffer such disgrace, but
the cowardly Infantes, laughing scornfully, mocked them, cast them off,
and so dealt with them that they left them for dead.
&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the dishonour of the affair of
the lion is avenged,&rdquo; and mounting their horses they rode
off.</p>
<p>As the deserted and dishonoured wives of the cowardly pair lay
bleeding on the grass, Feliz Mu&ntilde;oz, their cousin, who had lodged
during the night in another part of the forest, rode up, and seeing
their piteous condition hastened to their relief. Having dressed their
hurts to the best of his ability, he rode quickly to the nearest town
and purchased clothing and horses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>for them as befitted their
station. When these tidings reached the Cid in Valencia great anger
rose in his heart. He did not give it vent, however, but sat moodily
pondering upon the dishonour done to his daughters. At last, after many
hours, he spoke. &ldquo;By my beard!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the
Infantes of Carri&oacute;n shall not profit by this.&rdquo; Soon the
ladies Sol and Elvira arrived at Valencia, and he received them
lovingly, but not compassionately. &ldquo;Welcome, my daughters,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;God keep ye from evil! I accepted this marriage, for I
dared not gainsay it. God grant that I see you better married
hereafter, and that I have my revenge upon my sons-in-law of
Carri&oacute;n.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2250" class="main">The Court at Toledo</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Then the Cid dispatched messengers to King Alfonso,
acquainting him of the great wrong done to his daughters by the
Infantes, and pleading for justice. The King was greatly wroth at the
news, and ordered the Court to sit at Toledo and the Infantes to be
summoned before him to answer for their crime. They begged to be
excused attendance, but the King peremptorily refused to accept any
apology or subterfuge, and demanded their instant compliance with his
summons. With great misgivings they journeyed to Toledo, taking with
them the Count Don Garcia, Asur Gonz&aacute;lez, Gonzalo Asurez, and a
great band of dependents, thinking thereby to overawe the Cid. The
Campeador himself soon arrived at Court, with many a trusted veteran,
all armed to the teeth. He wore a rich robe of red fur broidered with
gold, and his beard was bound with a cord to preserve it. When he
entered the Court with his men all rose to greet him save the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>Infantes of Carri&oacute;n and their party, for he
seemed a great baron and the Infantes might not look at him for
shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Princes, barons, and hidalgos,&rdquo; said King Alfonso,
&ldquo;I have summoned ye here that justice may be done the Cid
Campeador. As ye all know, foul wrong has been done his daughters, and
I have set judges apart to moderate in this business and to search out
the right, for wrong I will not have in Christian Spain. I swear by the
bones of San Isidro that he who disturbs my Court shall quit my kingdom
and forfeit my love, and he who shall prove his right, on his side am
I. Now let the Cid make his demand and we shall hear the answer of the
Infantes of Carri&oacute;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then rose the Cid, and in the Court among all these great barons and
lords there was no nobler figure. &ldquo;My lord the King,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;it is not I alone whom the Infantes of Carri&oacute;n have
wronged, but yourself also, who gave them my daughters in marriage. Let
them first restore my swords Colada and Tizon, since they are no longer
my sons-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Infantes, hearing the Cid speak thus, thought that he would urge
no more against them if they restored the swords, and so they formally
handed them over to the King. But it was the Campeador&rsquo;s
intention to punish them by every means in his power, so when he
received the wondrous falchions from the hands of Alfonso he at once
presented them to Feliz Mu&ntilde;oz and Martin Antolinez, thus showing
that it was not for himself that he desired them. Having done this, he
turned once again to the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My liege,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when the Infantes left
Valencia I bestowed upon them three thousand marks in gold <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>and
silver. Let them now restore this, since they are no longer my
sons-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, if we do this,&rdquo; cried the Infantes, &ldquo;we must
even pay it out of our lands in Carri&oacute;n.&rdquo; But the judges
demanded that the sum be paid in Court without delay. The treacherous
princelings could not raise such a treasure in money, so the Court
decided that it must be paid in kind. Then the Infantes saw that there
was no help but to acquiesce, and brought many a steed and trained
palfrey with their furniture to repay the Cid, borrowing from the
members of their suite and entering into such obligations as would
burden them for many a day.</p>

<p class="first">When this matter had at last been settled, the Cid
then advanced his principal grievance against the Infantes, and asked
for redress by combat in the lists for the great wrong they had done
his daughters. At this Count Garcia, their spokesman, rose to defend
the Infantes. He pleaded that they were of princely degree, and for
that reason alone were justified in casting off the daughters of the
Cid. Then Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez, the elder of the Infantes,
himself rose to approve the speech of his vassal, and cast fresh scorn
upon the alliance he had made, justifying his cowardly action by his
princely rank as a thing quite natural and fitting. At this Pero
Bermuez opened the vials of his wrath upon the Infantes, taunting them
with cowardice in the affair of the lion and casting defiance of battle

<p class="line">Disordered were his garments and his mantle hung full

<p class="line">&ldquo;How now, my lords? What have we here? Thinkst
Carri&oacute;n to daunt?</p>
<p class="line">What bruit is this about the Cid, the lordling of
Bivar?</p>
<p class="line">At drawing tithes from dusty millers better is he
far</p>
<p class="line">Than ruffling at a Cort&eacute;s; he to match with
Carri&oacute;n!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Then up leapt Mu&ntilde;o Gustioz: &ldquo;Ha&rsquo;

<p class="line">Drunkard, who lookest on the wine before ye tell a

<p class="line">Who never yet did keep thy troth, evil in word and

<p class="line">The only boon I crave is but to have thee where my
sword</p>
<p class="line">May cut the false tongue from thy throat and cease thy
lying word.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Enough, enough,&rdquo; Alfonso cried, &ldquo;I
give thee my consent</p>
<p class="line">To meet each other in the lists; so ends this
Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The tumult which the King had endeavoured to abate had
hardly died away when two cavaliers entered the Court. The new-comers
were ambassadors from the Infantes of Navarre and Aragon, who had come
to request the King to bestow the hands of the Cid&rsquo;s daughters
upon their masters. Alfonso turned to the Cid and requested his
permission to ratify the marriage at once, and when the Campeador had
humbly given his consent he answered to the assembled nobles that the
espousals would duly take place, adding that the combat between the
disputants would be fought out on the morrow.</p>
<p>This was right woeful news to the Infantes of Carri&oacute;n, who,
in great fear, requested him to permit them some delay to procure
fitting horses and arms, so that at last the King scornfully fixed the
day of combat at three weeks from that date, and the place where it was
to be fought out as Carri&oacute;n itself, so that the Infantes should
have no grounds of excuse for absence or be able to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>plead
that the champions of the Cid had been granted any undue advantage.</p>
<p>The Cid then took his leave of the King, and on parting pressed him
to accept his courser Babieca. But Alfonso refused the proffered gift,
saying courteously that if he accepted it Babieca would not have so
good a lord. Turning to those who were to uphold his cause in the
lists, the Campeador bade them an affectionate farewell, and so he
departed for Valencia, and the King for Carri&oacute;n to see justice
done.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2318" class="main">The Trial by Combat</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the time of truce was over the contending parties
sought the lists. The Cid&rsquo;s men did not waste much time in arming
themselves, but the treacherous Infantes of Carri&oacute;n had brought
with them a number of their vassals in the hope that they might be able
to slay the Cid&rsquo;s champions by night, when they were off their
guard. But Antolinez and his comrades kept good watch and frustrated
their design. When they saw that there was no help for it but to meet
their challengers <i>&agrave; outrance</i>, they prayed the King that
the Cid&rsquo;s men might not be permitted to use the famous swords
Colada and Tizon, for they superstitiously dreaded the trenchancy of
these marvellous weapons, and bitterly repented that they had restored
them. Alfonso, however, refused to listen to this appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye have swords of your own,&rdquo; he said brusquely.
&ldquo;Let them suffice you, and see that you wield them like men, for,
believe me, there will be no shortcoming on the side of the
Campeador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trumpets sounded and the Cid&rsquo;s three champions leapt upon
their impatient destriers, first having made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>the sign
of the Cross upon their saddles. The Infantes of Carri&oacute;n also
mounted, but none so blithely. The marshals or heralds who were to
decide the rules of the combat, and give judgment in case of dispute,
took their places. Then said King Alfonso: &ldquo;Hear what I say,
Infantes of Carri&oacute;n. This combat ye should have fought at
Toledo, but ye would not, so I have brought these three cavaliers in
safety to the land of Carri&oacute;n. Take your right; seek no wrong:
who attempts it, ill betide him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The description of the scene that follows has more than once been
compared with Chaucer&rsquo;s description of the combat between Palamon
and Arcite in <i>The Knight&rsquo;s Tale</i>, and, as will be seen, a
resemblance certainly exists.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2336src" href=
"#xd19e2336" name="xd19e2336src">9</a></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">And now the marshals quit the lists and leave them face
to face;</p>
<p class="line">Their shields are dressed before their breasts, their
lances are in place.</p>
<p class="line">Each charger&rsquo;s flank now feels the spur, each
helm is bending low,</p>
<p class="line">The earth doth shake as horse and man hurl them upon
the foe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=

<p class="line">The echo of their meeting is a sound of meikle
dread,</p>
<p class="line">And all who hear the deadly shock count them as good as
sped.</p>
<p class="line">The false Ferrando and Bermuez strike lance on
either&rsquo;s shield,</p>
<p class="line">The Infant&rsquo;s spear goes through the boss, but the
stout shaft doth yield</p>
<p class="line">And splinters ere the point can pass thorough the
other&rsquo;s mail.</p>
<p class="line">But Pero&rsquo;s shaft struck home, nor did the
seasoned timber fail;</p>
<p class="line">It pierced Ferrando&rsquo;s corselet and sank into his
breast,</p>
<p class="line">And to the trampled ground there drooped the
Infant&rsquo;s haughty crest.</p>
<p class="line">Bermuez then drew Tizon&rsquo;s bright blade; ere ever
he could smite</p>
<p class="line">The Infant yielded him and cried, &ldquo;Thou hast the
victor&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">While this combat was proceeding Antolinez and the
other Infante came together. Each of their lances smote the
other&rsquo;s shield and splintered. Then, drawing their swords, they
rode fiercely against one another. Antolinez, flourishing Colada,
struck so mightily at Diego that the good blade shore its way clean
through the steel plates of his casque, and even cut half the hair from
Diego&rsquo;s head. The terrified princeling wheeled his courser and
fled, but Antolinez pursued him with mock fury and struck him across
the shoulders with the flat of his sword. So had the hound the
chastisement of cowards. As he felt the blade across his withers Diego
shrieked aloud and spurred past the boundaries of the lists, thus,
according to the rules of the combat, admitting himself vanquished.</p>
<p>When the trumpets of the pursuivants sounded, Mu&ntilde;o Gustioz
and Asur Gonz&aacute;lez ran swiftly and fiercely together. The point
of Asur&rsquo;s spear glanced off Mu&ntilde;o&rsquo;s armour, but that
of the Cid&rsquo;s champion pierced the shield of his opponent and
drove right through his breast, so that it stuck out a full fathom
between the shoulder-blades. The haughty Asur fell <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>heavily
to the ground, but had enough of life left in him to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>King Alfonso then duly credited the Cid&rsquo;s champions with the
victory, and without loss of time they returned to Valencia to acquaint
their master with the grateful news that his honour had been
avenged.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward the espousals of the Cid&rsquo;s daughters to the
noble Infantes of Navarre and Aragon were celebrated with much pomp.
The <i>Poema del Cid</i>, however, concludes as abruptly as it
begins:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">So in Navarre and Aragon his daughters both did
reign,</p>
<p class="line">And princes of his blood to-day sit on the thrones of
Spain.</p>
<p class="line">Greater and greater grew his name in honour and in
worth;</p>
<p class="line">At last upon a Pentecost he passed away from earth.</p>
<p class="line">Upon him be the grace of Christ, Whom all of us
adore.</p>
<p class="line">Such is the story, gentles, of the Cid Campeador.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cervantes&rsquo; summing-up upon the <i>Poema del
Cid</i> is perhaps the sanest on record. The Cid certainly existed in
the flesh; what matter, then, whether his achievements occurred or not?
For the Cid of romance is a very different person from the Cid of
history, who was certainly a born leader of men, but crafty,
unscrupulous, and cruel. The <i>Poema</i> is thus romance of no
uncertain type, and as this book deals with romance and not with
history, there is small need in this place to provide the reader with a
chronicle of the rather mercenary story of Roderigo of Bivar the
real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mio Cid,&rdquo; the title under which he is most frequently
mentioned, is a half Arabic, half Spanish rendering of the Arabic
<i>Sid-y</i>, &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; by which he was probably known to
his Moorish subjects in Valencia, and it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>unlikely
that he was given this appellation in Spain during his lifetime. But
even to this day it is a name to conjure with in the Peninsula. So long
as the heart of the Briton beats faster at the name of Arthur and the
Frenchman is thrilled by the name of Roland the Spaniard will not cease
to reverence that of the great romantic shadow which looms above the
early history of his land like a very god of war&mdash;the Cid
Campeador. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=

(<i>The Poem of the Cid</i>), who wrote in 1879, seems to have had the
most elementary notions of what a <i>cantar</i> was, and states that
the <i>Poema</i> &ldquo;was nearly contemporary with the first <i lang=
"fr">chansons de gestes</i>.&rdquo; But he is probably at least a
century out in his reckoning, as the first <i>chansons</i> date from
about the middle of the eleventh century. Of <i>trovador</i> and
<i>juglar</i> he had evidently never heard. Yet he is anything but
superficial, and on the whole his book is the best we have in English
on the <i>Poema</i>. It is unlucky, too, as Saintsbury remarks, that
neither Ticknor nor Southey, who wrote so widely on ancient Spanish
literature, were acquainted with the <i lang="fr">chansons de
gestes</i>. Still more luckless is it that so much in the way of
Spanish translation was left to Longfellow, who shockingly mangled and
Bowdlerized many fine ballads. Probably no poet was so well qualified
as he to divest a ballad of all pith and virility in the course of
translation. Bad as are his Spanish renderings, however, they are
adequate when compared with his exploits in the field of Italian
translation.</p>

"xd19e1726" href="#xd19e1726src" name="xd19e1726">4</a></span> A good
deal of controversy has arisen concerning the metre of the
<i>Poema</i>. Professor Cornu of Prague (see M. Gaston Paris, in
<i>Romania</i>, xxii, pp. 153, 531) has stated that the basis of it is
the ballad octosyllable, full or catalectic, arranged as hemistichs of
a longer line, but this theory presupposes that the copyists of the
original MS. must have mistaken such a simple measure, which is
scarcely credible. Professor Saintsbury (<i>Flourishing of Romance</i>,
p. 403) gives it as his opinion that &ldquo;nobody has been able to get
further in a generalization of the metre than that the normal form is
an eight and six (better a seven and seven) &lsquo;fourteener,&rsquo;
trochaically cadenced, but admitting contraction and extension with a
liberality elsewhere unparalleled.&rdquo; No absolute system of
assonance or rhyme appears, and we are almost forced to the conclusion
that the absence of this is in a measure due to the kind offices of
Abbot Pedro.</p>

passage in the <i>Poema del Cid</i> which tells of the combat that
followed has perhaps a better right than any other in the epic to the
title &lsquo;Homeric&rsquo; The translation which I furnish of it may
not be so exact as those of Frere or Ormsby. But although I am only too
conscious of its many shortcomings, I cannot bring myself to make use
of the pedestrian preciseness of the one or the praiseworthy version of
the other of my predecessors, both of which, in my view, fail to render
the magnificent spirit and chivalric dash of the original. All that I
can claim for my own translation is that it does not fail so utterly as
either in this regard. I have in places attempted the restoration of
lines which seemed to me omitted or coalesced with others, and I must
admit that this rendering of a great passage is more consciously
artificial than the others&mdash;a fault which I am unable to rectify.
But allowances must be made for the rendition of such a passage, and
the whole must be accepted by the reader <i lang="fr">faute de

Throughout the <i>Poema</i> and elsewhere the Cid is constantly alluded
to as &ldquo;Mio Cid&rdquo; (&ldquo;My lord&rdquo;). I deal with the
etymology of the name farther on, but hold to the form &lsquo;the
Cid&rsquo; as being most familiar to English readers.</p>

passage is reminiscent of the saying of the famous Border outlaw Jock
Eliot, when he and his men came upon a large haystack of which they
resolved to make fodder for their horses. &ldquo;Eh, man,&rdquo;

<p class="first">Many a casement in the grey castle of Spanish Romance
opens upon vistas of fantastic loveliness or gloomy grandeur, but none
commands a prospect so brilliant, so infinitely varied, or so rich in
the colours of fantasy as that aery embrasure overlooking the region of
marvel and high chivalry where is enacted the gallant and glorious
history of Amadis de Gaul. The window of which I speak is perched high
in a turret of the venerable fortalice, and displays such a landscape
as was dear to the weavers of ancient tapestries or the legend-loving
painters of old Florence. Beneath is spread a princely domain of noble
meadow-land, crossed and interlaced by the serpent-silver of narrow
rivers and rising northward to dim, castellated hills. Far beyond
these, remote and seeming more of sky than of earth, soar the blue and
jagged peaks of dragon-haunted mountains. This scene of almost
supernatural beauty presents, at the first glance, an unbroken richness
of colour and radiance. The meadow-land is populous <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>with
pavilions and the air is painted with pennons and gilded with the
blazonry of banners. The glitter of armour thrills the blood like the
challenge of martial music. Strange palaces of marble, white as
sculptured ice, rise at the verges of magic forests, or glitter on the
edges of the promontories, their gardens and terraces sloping to silent
and forlorn beaches. The scene is indeed &ldquo;Beautiful as a wreck of
Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such seems the book of <i>Amadis</i> when first we glance through
its rainbow-coloured pages. But when we gain a nearer view by the aid
of the romancer&rsquo;s magical glass we find that the radiant scene is
deeply shadowed in places. Ravines profound as night lie near the
castled hills, in which all manner of noxious things swarm and
multiply. The princely fortresses, the gay palaces, are often the
haunts of desperate outlaws or malignant sorcerers. Hideous giants
dwell in the mountains, or in the shadowy islands which rise from the
pale sea, and dragons have their lairs in fell and forest. But whether
it breed light or gloom, the atmosphere of <i>Amadis</i> is suffused
with such a glamour that we come to love the darker places; we feel
that the horror they hold is but the stronger wine of romance, a
vintage which intoxicates.</p>
<p>And if we remain at our point of vantage until nightfall and watch
the illumination of this wondrous region by the necromancy of moonshine
we shall be granted an even more inspiring draught from the strange
chalice of romance. In the mystery of moonlight armour is silvered to
an unearthly whiteness, blood-red lights gleam from the turrets of the
magicians, and the sylph-like shapes of sorceresses flit from sea to
forest like living moonbeams. From the deserts between the hills and
the distant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>mountains come the cries of ravening monsters, and
all the fantastic world of Fa&euml;ry is vivid with life.</p>
<p>What marvel then that when this surpassing picture was unveiled to
the eyes of a nation of knights it aroused such a fervour of applause
and appreciation as has been granted to few works in the history of
literary effort? The author of <i>Amadis</i> displayed to the chivalry
of Spain such a world as it had dreamed of. Every knight felt himself a
possible Amadis and every damsel deemed herself an Oriana. The
philosophy and atmosphere of the book took complete possession of the
soul of Spain, banishing grosser ideals and introducing a new code of
manners and sentiment. The main plot and the manifold incidents which
arise from it were coherently and skilfully arranged, and were not made
up of isolated and disconnected accounts of combats, or tedious
descriptions of apparel, appointments, or architecture, interspersed
with the boastful bellowings of rude paladins or vociferous kings, as
the &lsquo;plots&rsquo; of the <i>cantares de gesta</i> had been.
Moreover, the whole was powerfully infused with the love-philosophy of
chivalry, in which woman, instead of being the chattel and plaything of
man, found herself exalted to heights of worship, and even of
omnipotence, undreamed of by the ruder singers of the
<i>cantares</i>.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2511" class="main">Origin of the &ldquo;Amadis&rdquo;
Romances</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first Peninsular version of <i>Amadis</i> appeared
in a Portuguese dress, and was the work of a Lusitanian knight, Joham
de Lobeira (1261&ndash;1325), who was born at Porto, fought at
Aljubarrota, where he was knighted upon the field by King Joham of
happy memory, and died at Elvas. But Southey&rsquo;s protestations
notwithstanding, everything points to France as being the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>original
home of the romance, and there is even a reference in Portuguese
literature to the circumstance that a certain <i>Pedro</i> de Lobeira
translated <i>Amadis</i> from the French by order of the Infante Dom
Pedro, son of Joham I. The original French tale has vanished without
leaving a trace that it ever existed, save in the Peninsular versions
to which it gave birth, and we are no more fortunate as regards the
Portuguese rendering. A manuscript copy of Lobeira&rsquo;s romance was
known to exist at the close of the sixteenth century in the archives of
the Dukes of Arveiro at Lisbon, and appears to have been extant as late
as 1750. After that period, however, it disappears from the sight of
the bibliophile, and all the evidence points to its having been
destroyed at the earthquake at Lisbon in 1755, along with the ducal
palace in which it was housed.</p>
<p>Its fame, as well as its matter, was, however, kept alive by the
Spanish version, and if we must regard Portugal as the original home of
<i>Amadis</i> in the Peninsula, it is to the genius of Castile that we
owe not only its preservation, but its possible improvement. At some
time between 1492 and 1508 Garcia Ordo&ntilde;ez de Montalvo, governor
of the city of Medina del Campo, addressed himself to the task of its
translation and adaptation. At what precise date it was first printed
is obscure. Early copies are lacking, but we learn that the Spanish
conquerors of Mexico remarked upon the resemblance of that city to the
places of enchantment spoken of in <i>Amadis</i>. This occurred in
1519, not 1549, as stated by Southey. They may, perhaps, have referred
to the Portuguese version, but in any case an edition of <i>Amadis</i>
is known to have been published in that year, and another at Seville in
1547. Reference has already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>been made to the numerous
translations of the romance in all languages, and to the equally
manifold continuations of it by several hands, but it is necessary to
remark that only the first four books of <i>Amadis</i>&mdash;that is,
those which constitute the <i>Amadis</i> proper&mdash;were written by
Montalvo, the remainder being the independent and original work of
imitators.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2546src" href="#xd19e2546" name=

<p class="first">The action of the romance begins at an obscure and
indefinite period, described as following almost immediately upon the
death of our Redeemer, at which time, we are told, there flourished in
Brittany a Christian king named Garinter, who was blessed with two
lovely daughters. The elder, known as &lsquo;the Lady of the
Garland,&rsquo; because of her fondness for wearing a coronel of
flowers, had some years before the period of the story&rsquo;s
commencement been wed to King Languines (Angus) of Scotland, and had
two beautiful children, Agrayes and Mabilia. Elisena, the younger
daughter, was famed for her beauty throughout the lands of Christendom,
but though many powerful monarchs and princes had asked her hand in
marriage, she would wed with none, but gave herself up to a life of
holiness and good works. In the opinion of all the knights and ladies
of her father&rsquo;s realm, one so fair grievously transgressed the
laws of love by remaining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>single, and it came to pass that the
beautiful and saintly Elisena earned from the more worldly of her gay
critics the name of &lsquo;the Lost Devotee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If Elisena was devoted to a life of austerity her royal father was
equally partial to the pleasures of the chase, and spent much of his
time in the green forest-land which occupied the greater part of Lesser
Britain in those remote days. On one of those occasions, as he rode
unattended in the greenwood, as was his wont, he chanced to hear the
clash of arms, and, riding to a clearing whence came the sounds of
combat, he saw two knights of Brittany attacking an armed stranger,
whom he guessed by his armour and bearing to be a person of rank and
distinction, and who bore himself with such courage and address that he
succeeded in slaying both his opponents.</p>
<p>As the stranger was in the act of sheathing his weapon he observed
Garinter, and rode forward to meet him, saluting him with a courteous
mien. He complained that in a Christian country an errant knight did
not expect such treatment from its inhabitants as had been meted out to
him, to which the King sagely replied that in all countries evilly
disposed people were to be found as well as good folk, and that the
slain knights had been traitors to their liege lord and well deserved
their fate.</p>
<p>The stranger then proffered the information that he sought the King
of Brittany with tidings of a friend, and on learning this Garinter
revealed his identity. The knight then informed him that he was King
Perion of Gaul, who had long desired his friendship. Garinter insisted
that his brother monarch should accompany him to his palace, and Perion
consenting, they turned their horses&rsquo; heads toward the city.</p>
<p>Arrived at the palace, they sat down to a rich banquet, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>which
was graced by the Queen and the Princess Elisena. No sooner did Elisena
and Perion behold one another than they knew that a great and deathless
love had sprung up between them. When the Queen and Princess had risen
from the banquet Elisena divulged her love for Perion to her damsel and
confidante, Darioleta, and asked her to discover whether the King of
Gaul had pledged his troth to any other lady. Darioleta, who was not
easily abashed, went straight to Perion, who avowed his love for
Elisena in passionate terms and promised to take her to wife. He begged
the damsel to bring him to where Elisena was, that he might have the
happiness of expressing his love in person, and she returned to the
Princess with his message. So impatient was Elisena to hear from
Perion&rsquo;s own lips that he loved her, that, recking not of time or
tide, she sought the apartment in which he was lodged, where she
remained until dawn, detained by his protestations of affection and her
own devotion to the noble and knightly monarch who had so suddenly made
her regard her former mode of life as savourless and melancholy.</p>

</div>
<p>Ten days did Perion sojourn at the Court of Garinter. At the end of
that time it became necessary that he should depart, but before he took
his leave he plighted his troth to Elisena, and left her one of two
duplicate rings he wore, as a pledge of his faith. Search as he might,
however, he failed to find his good sword, a tried and trusty weapon,
and at last was forced to abandon the search for it.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2586" class="main">The Birth and Casting Away of
Amadis</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When her lover had gone Elisena was plunged in the
deepest grief, and all the comfort which Darioleta could <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>bestow
upon her failed to rouse her from the lethargy of sorrow into which she
had fallen. In her father&rsquo;s kingdom, as in modern Scotland, an
old law existed which provided that if two persons solemnly took each
other in marriage by oath no further ceremony was necessary to render
the union legal, although it was usual to have it ratified later by
both Church and law. Perion and Elisena had taken these vows upon
themselves, but the Princess dreaded the wrath of her father, whom the
lovers had not consulted, and when a little son was born to her she was
in great fear of the consequences, for she knew her father to be both
proud and hasty and prone to act before he learned the truth of a
matter. The worldly and quick-witted Darioleta had, however, no
scruples regarding the manner in which she resolved to save her
mistress and herself from the King&rsquo;s wrath, and despite the
protestations of Elisena, who in her weakness was unable to restrain
her, she built a little ark of wood, made it water-tight with pitch,
and, regardless of the tears and lamentations of her mistress, placed
the new-born baby boy therein with Perion&rsquo;s sword, which she had
abstracted from his sleeping-chamber. Then she wrote upon a piece of
parchment, &ldquo;This is Amadis, son of a king,&rdquo; covered the
writing with wax so that it might be preserved from obliteration, and,
securing it to the betrothal ring which Perion had given to Elisena,
fastened it by a silken cord round the infant&rsquo;s neck. Then with
the utmost caution, lest any one should observe her action, she carried
the tiny vessel to the river which ran at the foot of the palace garden
and launched it upon the swift, deep waters.</p>
<p>The little ark was rapidly carried out to sea, which was not more
than half a league distant, and it had scarcely <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>emerged
upon the tossing billows when it was sighted by the mariners of a
Scottish vessel which bore a Caledonian knight, Gandales, back from
Gaul to his home in the North. At his orders the sailors launched a
boat, and having secured the tiny vessel, brought it to the ship, when
the wife of Gandales, delighted with the beauty of the infant it held,
decided to adopt him as her own. In a few days the vessel put into the
Scottish port of Antalia,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2596src" href=
"#xd19e2596" name="xd19e2596src">2</a> and Gandales carried the little
Amadis to his castle, where he brought him up with his own son,
Gandalin.</p>
<p>Some years afterward, when Amadis was about five years old,
Languines, the King of Scotland, and his Queen, &lsquo;the Lady of the
Garland,&rsquo; and sister to Elisena, paid a visit to the castle of
Gandales, and were so greatly attracted by the child&rsquo;s grace and
beauty that they expressed a desire to adopt him as their own. Gandales
acquainted them with what he knew of Amadis&rsquo;s history, and the
royal pair promised to regard him as their own son. Amadis, because of
the circumstances of his strange discovery, was known to every one as
&lsquo;the Child of the Sea,&rsquo; and indeed this mysterious and
poetic name cleaved to him until his identity had been proven beyond
cavil. He showed no reluctance to accompany his new guardians, although
he was grieved at having to part with his first foster-parents, but the
little Gandalin would in no wise be separated from him, and begged so
hard to be permitted to share his fortunes that at last King Languines
took both the boys under his protection. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 id="xd19e2603" class="main">Perion&rsquo;s Dream</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us return to King Perion. Occupied once more with
the affairs of his kingdom, he still knew great heaviness of spirit
because of a dream that he had had while at the Court of Garinter. It
seemed to him in his dream that some one entered his
sleeping-apartment, thrust a hand through his side, and, taking out his
heart, cast it into the river that flowed through King Garinter&rsquo;s
garden. Crying out in his anguish, he was answered by a voice that
another heart was still left to him. Troubled by memory of the dream,
which he could not unriddle, he called together all the wise men of his
realm and requested them to attempt its solution. Only one of them
could unravel the mystery, and the sage who did so assured him that the
heart which had been abstracted represented a son which a noble lady
had borne him, while the remaining heart symbolized another son who
would in some manner be taken away against the will of her who had cast
away the first.</p>
<p>As the King left the wise man&rsquo;s presence he encountered a
mysterious damsel, who saluted him and said: &ldquo;Know, King Perion,
that when thou recoverest thy loss the kingdom of Ireland shall lose
its flower&rdquo;; and ere the King could detain or question her she
had gone.</p>
<p>In course of time King Garinter died, and Perion and Elisena were
formally wedded. But when Perion asked his wife if she had borne him a
son, so bitterly ashamed was she of the part she had been forced to
play in the matter of the child&rsquo;s disappearance that she denied
everything. Later, two beautiful children were born to them, a son and
a daughter, called Galaor and Melicia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>When Galaor was but
two and a half years old, the King and Queen, at that time sojourning
at a town called Banzil, near the sea, were walking in the gardens of
the palace there, when suddenly a monstrous giant rose out of the waves
and, catching up the little Galaor, made off with him before anyone
could prevent him.</p>
<p>The monster, dashing into the water, clambered on board a ship and
put out to sea, crying out joyfully, as he did so: &ldquo;The damsel
told me true!&rdquo; The parents were deeply afflicted at the loss of
their son, and in her grief Elisena admitted the casting away of
Amadis. Then Perion knew that what the wise man had told him regarding
the loss of the two hearts was the truth indeed.</p>
<p>Now the giant who had stolen the little Galaor was not of the race
of evil monsters, but was generous in disposition and gentle in
demeanour. Indeed, he took as much care of the child as if he had been
one of his own gigantic brood. He was a native of Lyonesse, was known
as Gandalue, and was the master of two castles in an island of the sea.
He had peopled this island with Christian folk, and gave the little
Galaor into the keeping of a holy hermit, with strict orders to educate
him as a brave and loyal knight. He told the hermit that a
damsel&mdash;the same who had addressed King Perion so strangely, and
who was a powerful sorceress&mdash;had assured him that only a son of
Perion could conquer his lifelong and ruthless enemy, the giant
Albadan,<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2617src" href="#xd19e2617" name=

from him the rock Galtares. And so Galaor was left in the care of the
hermit.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2625" class="main">Oriana</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">About this time King Lisuarte of Britain chanced to
put into a port of Scotland, where he was honourably received by King
Languines. With Lisuarte was his wife Brisena, and his beautiful little
daughter Oriana, the fairest creature in the world. And because she
suffered so much at sea, her parents decided to leave her for a space
at the Court of Scotland. Amadis was now twelve years old, but seemed
fifteen, so tall and hardy was he, and the Queen bestowed him upon
Oriana for her service. Oriana said that &lsquo;it pleased her,&rsquo;
and Amadis cherished those words in his heart, so that they never faded
from his memory. But he knew not that Oriana loved him, and was greatly
in awe of the lovely and serious little maiden of ten, for whom he
conceived a high and noble affection. Very beautiful was the silent
love of these children for one another. But silent it remained, for
Amadis was fearful of presumption and Oriana the most modest of little
damsels.</p>
<p>High thoughts of chivalry now began to stir in the heart of Amadis,
so that at last he requested King Languines to grant him the boon of
knighthood. Languines was greatly surprised that a mere boy should
crave such a heavy burden of honour, but approved his desire, and gave
orders that arms should be made for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>him. He sent to
Gandales, the knight who had found Amadis in the sea, acquainting him
with the lad&rsquo;s purpose, and Gandales dispatched a messenger to
Court with the sword, ring, and parchment which he had found in the ark
along with the sea-borne baby.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2633src"
href="#xd19e2633" name="xd19e2633src">4</a></p>
<p>These things were delivered to Amadis as belonging to him, and when
he showed them to Oriana she begged for the wax that contained the
parchment, not knowing it held anything of moment, and accordingly he
gave it to her. Shortly after this King Perion arrived on a visit to
Languines, to ask his help against King Abies of Ireland, who had
invaded Gaul with all the force of his kingdom. Amadis, knowing
Perion&rsquo;s great reputation as a warrior, much desired to be
knighted by his hand, and asked the Queen to crave the boon on his
behalf. But she seemed sad and distraught, and heeded him not. He
inquired of Oriana the cause of the Queen&rsquo;s sadness, and she
replied: &ldquo;Child of the Sea, this is the first thing ye ever asked
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, lady,&rdquo; replied Amadis, &ldquo;I am not worthy to
ask anything from such as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Is then your heart so
feeble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, lady,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;in all things toward
you, save that it would serve you like one who is not his own, but
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; said Oriana, mystified; &ldquo;since
when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since &lsquo;it pleased you,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Amadis,
with a smile. &ldquo;Do you not remember your words when the Queen
offered me for your service?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am well pleased that it should be so,&rdquo; said Oriana
shyly, and beholding Amadis much overcome at her gracious answer, she
slipped away to ask the Queen the cause of her sorrow.</p>
<p>The Queen told her that she was deeply distressed because of her
sister Elisena, whose kingdom had been invaded, and, returning to
Amadis, Oriana explained to him why his royal mistress had left his
appeals unanswered. Amadis at once expressed a desire to proceed to
Gaul to fight against the Irish invaders, and Oriana applauded his
intention. &ldquo;You shall go to the wars as my knight,&rdquo; she
said, simply but graciously. Amadis kissed her hand, and requested her
to ask the Princess Mabilia, Perion&rsquo;s daughter (and
Amadis&rsquo;s sister) to bring it about that her father should confer
the honour of knighthood upon him. The little damsel readily consented
to do so, and King Perion joyfully acquiesced in the young man&rsquo;s
eager desire to embrace the profession of arms. So, asking him to
kneel, he bestowed upon him the accolade, fastened the knightly spurs
upon his heels, and girded the sword to his side.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd19e2657" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2658" class="main">Amadis Goes on Adventure</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now Amadis resolved to set out for Gaul at once, so,
taking a tender leave of Oriana and accompanied by Gandalin, his
foster-brother, he rode off from the palace at nightfall. They had not
gone far when they encountered the mysterious sorceress who, as we have
seen, took such an interest in the fate of our hero, and whose name was
Urganda.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e2662src" href="#xd19e2662" name=
"xd19e2662src">5</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fay greeted Amadis in a most gracious manner, and presented him
with a lance, which she told him would, within three days,
&ldquo;preserve the house from which he was descended from
death.&rdquo; With her was another damsel, and when Urganda had
departed her companion remained and announced to Amadis that she would
journey with him for three days, and that she was not a familiar of the
sorceress, but had encountered her by chance. They had not ridden far
when they came to a castle, where they heard a squire lamenting loudly
that his master was beset therein by its inmates. Amadis spurred his
horse into the courtyard, and beheld King Perion fiercely attacked by
two knights and a number of men-at-arms. With a cry of defiance he fell
upon the attackers, striking left and right and dealing such terrific
blows that the caitiff knights who had assailed the King were slain and
their retainers put to flight.</p>
<p>Perion at once recognized Amadis as the youth he had knighted not
long since. Leaving the castle, they came to a fork in the road, where
they parted, with mutual promises to meet in Gaul. The damsel who had
so far accompanied him now told Amadis that she was in reality a
messenger from Oriana, whereat Amadis trembled so with joy at hearing
his lady&rsquo;s name that had not Gandalin supported him he had fallen
from the saddle. The damsel then took her leave, saying that she would
acquaint her mistress of his welfare.</p>
<p>After several other adventures which it would be tedious to recount,
Amadis arrived with Gandalin at the Court of King Perion, in Gaul. They
had scarcely rested themselves when they heard the clarions of King
Abies of Ireland sound for an attack upon the city, and, mounting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>their destriers, sallied forth, with Agrayes and
other knights, to give the men of Ireland battle. A stubborn contest
ensued, in which Amadis performed prodigies of valour. Perion came up
with his men, but they found themselves greatly outnumbered by the host
of King Abies, and were forced to give ground. However, the day was
retrieved by Amadis, who charged with such fury that neither horse nor
man might withstand him, and in the press he slew, among others,
Daugavel, a favourite of Abies. Hearing this, Abies grieved full
sorely, and, encountering Amadis, challenged him to a mortal combat on
the following day. They met, and after a fierce duel, which lasted
several hours, Abies was slain, and the war was thus ended at a
blow.</p>
<p>Now Melicia, Perion&rsquo;s daughter, lost a ring which had been
given her by her father, the same indeed as that which the King had
worn when first he met Elisena, and the exact counterpart of the ring
he had bestowed upon her, and which she had tied to the neck of Amadis
when he was cast adrift. Rather than that her father should know of
this loss, Amadis gave Melicia his own ring. But the King himself
recovered the lost jewel, and made inquiries regarding the resemblance
between the rings, asking his daughter where she had procured its
counterpart. Through her explanation, and his recognition of the sword
which Amadis wore, Perion felt certain that Amadis could be no other
than his long-lost son, and when the young knight recounted the
circumstances of his history, how that he had been found in the sea,
the last doubts of his parents regarding his identity were quite
dissipated, and they were overjoyed at recovering him, publicly
acknowledging him as prince of the realm. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>We must now follow the fortunes of Galaor, brother of Amadis, who
had been so suddenly snatched away in his infancy by the giant. In due
time he grew to be a youth of courage and address, and as he had heard
that at no Court did chivalry flourish so gallantly as at that of King
Lisuarte of Britain, he resolved to journey thither in the hope of
receiving the honour of knighthood. His giant foster-father accompanied
him, and they had travelled but two days when they came to the castle
of a felon knight, whom, with his retainers, they saw attacking a
single champion. Galaor spurred to the rescue, and by his aid the
caitiff crew were slain or routed. Galaor conceived such an affection
for the stranger that he requested knighthood at his hands. This was
cheerfully granted, and after Amadis&mdash;for the stranger knight was
none other&mdash;had taken his departure, Galaor, beholding a damsel
close at hand, asked her if she was aware of the name of the knight he
had assisted. The damsel, who was the sorceress Urganda, replied that
his name was Amadis, and that he was own brother to Galaor. On hearing
this Galaor was overjoyed, but his satisfaction was mingled with a deep
regret that he had not discovered their relationship ere they had taken
leave of one another.</p>
<p>Not content with having enlightened Galaor, Urganda hastened after
Amadis, who was on his way to the Court of King Lisuarte at Windsor.
She told him that his rescuer was his brother Galaor, who had been
stolen in youth, whereat he was both overjoyed and sorrowful.</p>
<p>Greatly heartened by the strange encounter, Galaor still pressed on
to the goal of his adventure, the rock Galtares, which he hoped to free
for ever from the tyrannous rule of the monster who usurped it. A few
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>days&rsquo; journey brought him to the
fortalice, and at his defiance the giant issued from his castle, armed
at all points, mounted upon a gigantic charger, and mouthing the most
terrible threats imaginable. He rode fiercely at the young knight,
hoping to end the combat at a blow. But, striking out wildly with his
club, he smote down his own horse, came thundering to the ground, and
Galaor spurred his courser over his prostrate body. In doing so,
however, he fell from his charger, and received a terrible buffet from
the giant. Recovering himself, he drew his sword and severed the
monster&rsquo;s arm at the shoulder. This blow practically ended the
combat, for Galaor with another sweep of his good blade beheaded his
gigantic adversary.</p>
<p>Amadis, arriving at the Court of King Lisuarte, mingled with its
chivalry, and partook of its adventures with such zest that he came to
be known as one of the most illustrious knights in Christendom. His
adventures at the Court of Lisuarte would fill a goodly volume, and
included a war of extermination against the giants, the defeat of the
usurper Barsinan and the enchanter Archelaus, as well as a score of
other exploits, even a meagre account of which would overflow the pages
set apart for the description of this romance. His adventures are
intertwined with those of his brother Galaor, whom he even once meets
in fierce combat, neither recognizing the other because of his
armour.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2694" class="main">Lisuarte&rsquo;s Vow</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now, while Lisuarte held court in London an aged
knight entered and displayed such a marvellously wrought crown and
mantle that the King eagerly offered him any price he might ask for
them. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>knight declared that he would return on a
certain day and claim his reward, and the King agreed to keep the crown
and mantle with all care, upon pain of losing that which he loved best.
The knight was an emissary of the false enchanter Archelaus, and the
gauds he had shown Lisuarte were made by magic art, so that when the
King desired to wear them and unlocked the coffer in which they were
kept he found they had vanished. The aged knight returned, and demanded
his recompense. Lisuarte was forced to admit the loss of the crown and
mantle, and the creature of the cunning magician demanded the Princess
Oriana in pledge of the King&rsquo;s vow. In true romantic compliance
with his promise, Lisuarte weakly acquiesced, and the knight rode off
with Oriana, whom he at once placed in the power of Archelaus, and
Lisuarte himself fell into a trap set by the artful enchanter.</p>
<p>Learning of this treason while at some distance from the Court,
Amadis and Galaor hurried to Windsor, resolved to frustrate the
necromancer&rsquo;s wicked intention, which was to wed Oriana to the
pretender to the British throne, the false Barsinan, whom Amadis had
already worsted. Galaor speedily delivered Lisuarte from his enemies,
and Amadis, searching high and low for his lady, at last encountered
her in a forest, through which she was being carried by Archelaus. On
beholding the doughty champion, whose reputation was only too well
known to him, the enchanter hastily made off, leaving Oriana with her
lover, who conducted her back to Court.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e2703" class="main">The Firm Island</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the commencement of the Second Book we enter a
strange and mystic atmosphere. Indeed the book <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>may
be called the <i>cor cordium</i> of romance, its mirror, its
quintessence. It introduces us to Apolidon, son of a King of Greece,
who is described as a valiant knight and powerful necromancer.
Abandoning his inheritance to a younger brother, he sailed from Greece
into the Great Sea, where he discovered an island inhabited by peasants
only, and ruled by a frightful giant, which was known as the Firm
Island, fated to be celebrated in the pages of romance along with many
another insular paradise.</p>
<p>Slaying the monstrous tyrant, Apolidon dwelt in the isle until, on
the death of his brother, he returned to sit upon the Grecian throne.
But ere he left the place he laid a potent enchantment upon it to the
purpose that no knight or lady might dwell there save such as were
equal in valour to himself or in beauty to his lady Grymenysa.</p>
<p>The wonders of this magical island well merit description, and as
much of the action of our romance centres there let us embark upon the
fairy galley which lies ever ready in the harbours of legend, sail
thither, and set foot upon its enchanted beaches. Perhaps it is only
through the rainbow lenses of poesy that we can view this wondrous
region aright, so I have essayed a description of the isle in
verse.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4>The Firm Island</h4>
<p class="line">Prince Apolidon the Mage</p>
<p class="line">Raised a mystic hermitage</p>
<p class="line">On an island in a shipless sea</p>
<p class="line">By necromantic potency,</p>
<p class="line">Carving the granite gateways of its cliffs</p>
<p class="line">With interdicting seals and hieroglyphs,</p>
<p class="line">That his unequals might not habit there,</p>
<p class="line">Nor drink that island&rsquo;s consecrated air.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=

<p class="line">White terraces o&rsquo;erhung the black abyss,</p>
<p class="line">Fair as the gardens Queen Semiramis</p>
<p class="line">Piled above Babylon: the glittering height</p>
<p class="line">Seemed as the day empillared on the night.</p>
<p class="line">And from the ocean-green of myrtle&rsquo;s shadow</p>
<p class="line">Rose a pavilion, which from afar</p>
<p class="line">Seemed to the eyes of shipmen as a star</p>
<p class="line">Shattered on a distant meadow.</p>
<p class="line">Betwixt this palace and the shipless sea</p>
<p class="line">The wizard set an arch of glamourie,</p>
<p class="line">Byzantine, builded as from golden air.</p>
<p class="line">Its fretted alcove held an image rare,</p>
<p class="line">In whose uplifted hand there burned and shone</p>
<p class="line">The brazen brightness of a clarion.</p>
<p class="line">And should a lady or a knight,</p>
<p class="line">Lesser in beauty or in might</p>
<p class="line">Than wise Apolidon the wight</p>
<p class="line">Or Grymenysa fair</p>
<p class="line">Seek to traverse the magic vault,</p>
<p class="line">Or make the palace by assault,</p>
<p class="line">The brazen trump would blare,</p>
<p class="line">And vomit such a horrid blast</p>
<p class="line">That, fainting from the garden cast,</p>
<p class="line">The wretch would perish there.</p>
<p class="line">But, should a knight of equal fame</p>
<p class="line">Or lady of unblemished name</p>
<p class="line">Seek entrance by the port,</p>
<p class="line">The trumpet, with a high fanfare</p>
<p class="line">Of praise, would waken all the air</p>
<p class="line">Of that celestial court.</p>
<p class="line">Two crystal pillars marked the magic line;</p>
<p class="line">A tablature of jasper, serpentine,</p>
<p class="line">Surround by arabesques like carven flame,</p>
<p class="line">On which would flash the lineage and name</p>
<p class="line">Of that illustrious paladin or dame,</p>
<p class="line">Gleamed in the Grecian pavement; who did pass</p>
<p class="line">Those pillars frozen in Ph&oelig;nician glass</p>
<p class="line">Would see, &rsquo;mid splendour like reflecting
ice,</p>
<p class="line">The lord and lady of that paradise</p>
<p class="line">Moulded in immortality of brass. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Still deeper in those labyrinths of pleasure</p>
<p class="line">A siege right perilous the Mage did make</p>
<p class="line">For Grymenysa&rsquo;s fair, mysterious sake,</p>
<p class="line">For glory of a love withouten measure,</p>
<p class="line">Setting nine seals of Babylonian doom</p>
<p class="line">Upon the entrance to her ivory room,</p>
<p class="line">That but the highest hearts the world had seen</p>
<p class="line">Might know the rapture of its air serene.</p>
<p class="line">And that no sordidness might pass therein</p>
<p class="line">He sentinelled the door with savage jinn,</p>
<p class="line">Invisible and with the flaming powers</p>
<p class="line">Of Sheol in their guarding <span class="corr" id=
"xd19e2846" title="Source: scimetars">scimitars</span>.</p>
<p class="line">And all the webs of his weird soul were woven,</p>
<p class="line">In mazy mystery of charm and spell,</p>
<p class="line">Around the shadows of that citadel,</p>
<p class="line">Where oft his wizard prowess had been proven.</p>
<p class="line">So did he leave the place of his delight</p>
<p class="line">To sinful spirits in a magic night,</p>
<p class="line">Calling on Siduri and Sabitu,</p>
<p class="line">And Baphomet, in syllables of might.</p>
<p class="line">And when the moon was in her thinnest phase</p>
<p class="line">He left that island in the shipless sea,</p>
<p class="line">No man knew how, nor evermore did he</p>
<p class="line">Return unto its labyrinthine ways.</p>
<p class="line">Still in the dawn&rsquo;s white fire the shepherd
sees</p>
<p class="line">Shapes whiter than the dawn, and whisperings</p>
<p class="line">Sigh through the shadows of the myrtle-trees,</p>
<p class="line">Like to the mutterings of invisible kings</p>
<p class="line">Who speak of blessed, heart-remembered things.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Before he had quitted this marvellous island Prince
Apolidon had placed a governor over it, and had commanded that any who
failed to pass the Arch of Honour and still survived the dread blast of
the trumpet should without ceremony be cast out of the island, but that
such as sustained the ordeal were to be entertained and served with all
honour. And he willed that when the island should have another lord the
enchantment should cease.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=

<p>Now the spell had been laid upon the island for about a hundred
years when Amadis, who had taken a fond farewell of Oriana, and was on
adventure bound, encountered a damsel who told him of the wonders of
the Firm Island, which, she said, was scarcely two days&rsquo; sail
from where he then sojourned. Amadis replied that he could desire
nothing better than to essay such an adventure, and the damsel&rsquo;s
father, a knight of large estate, agreed to guide him there so that he
might essay the perilous adventure. When at last they came to the Firm
Island they beheld the pavilion, the walls of which were hung with the
shields of those who had tried the adventure but failed, for though
several had passed the arch none had penetrated to the pavilion. And
when Amadis saw that so many good knights had been undone his heart
misgave him.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd19e2895" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2896" class="main">Amadis Passes the Archway</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Amadis was accompanied by Agrayes, son of King
Languines of Scotland, who decided to attempt the passage of the arch
at once. As he passed through it the trumpet held by the image emitted
sweet music, and he entered the pavilion. Then Amadis approached the
archway, and the trumpet blew louder and more melodiously than it had
ever done before. Both knights approached the forbidden chamber. They
saw the jasper slab, on which they read: &ldquo;This is Amadis of Gaul,
the true lover, son of King Perion.&rdquo; As they looked upon it
Amadis&rsquo;s dwarf, Ardian, ran to his master and told him that
Galaor and Florestan, his brothers, who had also accompanied him on the
adventure, had attempted the passage of the arch, but had been attacked
on all sides by unseen hands, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113"
href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>left for dead. Amadis and
Agrayes at once retraced their steps, and found the young knights lying
as in a deep swoon. While Amadis was giving his brothers such
assistance as he could, Agrayes tried to enter the forbidden chamber,
but he too was struck senseless.</p>
<p>When Galaor and Florestan had somewhat recovered from the effects of
the blows they had received from invisible assailants, Amadis felt that
for the honour of his lady, Oriana, he must attempt the great adventure
of entering the forbidden chamber, into which no knight had yet
penetrated. Summoning all his courage to his aid, he crossed the line
of the spell between the pillars, and immediately felt himself
assaulted by the unseen warriors who had defeated his comrades. A
terrific uproar of voices arose, as if all the knights in the world
were assailing him, and the blows were doubled in force and violence.
But, nothing daunted, and strong in memory of his lady, he fought on.
Sometimes he was beaten to his knees, and once his sword fell from his
hand, yet he struggled on until he reached the door of the chamber,
which opened as if to admit him. A hand came forth and, seizing his,
drew him in, and a voice exclaimed: &ldquo;Welcome is the knight who
shall be lord here, because he surpasses in prowess him who made the
enchantment and who had no peer in his time.&rdquo; The hand that led
him was large and hard, like that of an old man, and the arm was
sleeved with green satin. As soon as he was in the chamber it vanished,
and Amadis felt his strength return to him.</p>
<p>When Florestan and Galaor and the people of the island heard that
the adventure had at last been achieved, they crowded into the now
disenchanted palace and gazed upon its wonders. It was full of the most
marvellous treasures <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"
name="pb114">114</a>]</span>and works of art, but nothing more
excellent was there than the statues of Apolidon and Grymenysa.</p>
</div>

<div id="xd19e2908" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2909" class="main">Oriana&rsquo;s Cruelty</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the time Amadis had left Britain and had said
farewell to Oriana he dispatched his dwarf, Ardian, back to the palace
for the pieces of a sword which a lady had given him in all good faith,
asking him to avenge her father&rsquo;s death on a cowardly murderer.
Amadis, like a good knight, had promised to keep the broken blade until
he had avenged the dead man. Oriana, seeing the dwarf return, asked him
the reason, and Ardian told her that Amadis had promised a lady ever to
keep a certain sword, for which he had been sent back. Then he fetched
the blade and galloped off. Oriana, putting a wrong construction upon
the dwarf&rsquo;s words, and suspecting Amadis of unfaithfulness to
her, wrote him a cruel letter, which she entrusted to a page with
instructions to find him at all costs. After much journeying he traced
Amadis to the Firm Island, and delivered the letter into his hands.</p>
<p>When Amadis had perused the cold and bitter words of his lady he
seemed to the messenger as a man distraught. The page told him that he
was forbidden to carry any reply to Oriana. Amadis in terrible grief
called for Ysanjo, the governor of the island, and requested him as a
loyal knight to keep secret all that he might see till after his
brothers had heard Mass on the morrow. Then he commanded Ysanjo to open
the gate of the palace privily so that he might withdraw his horse and
arms therefrom without being observed by anyone. Accompanied by the
honest Ysanjo, for whom he had formed a high esteem, he betook himself
to a chapel of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>the Virgin hard by. He prayed fervently that she
would intercede with her Divine Son to have mercy upon him, as he felt
that his days would be few. Then he rose and, taking an affectionate
leave of the Governor, mounted his horse and, without shield, spear, or
helmet, rode off.</p>
<p>Now Gandalin, squire to Amadis, and son of the Scottish knight
Gandales, who throughout all these adventures had never left his
master, took counsel with Durin, the messenger who had brought
Oriana&rsquo;s cruel letter to the Firm Island, and resolved to follow
the distraught knight, lest he should come to harm. They soon found him
sleeping beside a fountain, worn out with the violence of his sorrow,
and mercifully allowed him to slumber on. But when night had fallen
Amadis awoke and, remembering his wretchedness, broke into pitiful
lamentations for his evil fate. The youths concealed themselves, for
they did not wish him to know of their presence. But Amadis, catching
sight of Gandalin, was angry with him for having followed him. To
arouse him from his lethargy Gandalin told him that a knight, like
himself abandoned by his lady, was in the neighbourhood, threatening
vengeance upon any whom he might encounter. Amadis, minded to throw
away his life, leapt on his horse at hearing this, and accompanied
Gandalin in search of the crazy challenger. They soon came up with the
unknown, and Amadis hurled a fierce defiance at him. A stubborn combat
ensued, and Amadis, by a desperate blow, struck his opponent senseless.
Leaving the wounded knight with Durin, Amadis rode on, still followed
by the faithful Gandalin.</p>
<p>Galaor, Florestan, and Agrayes, hearing of Amadis&rsquo;s plight and
his hurried departure, resolved to follow him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>Meanwhile the object of their search rode
onward, allowing his horse to choose its own path, and given over to
weeping and lamentation. While the anxious Gandalin slept, the crazed
lover eluded him, and traversed the wildest parts of the savage country
which they had penetrated. Ere long he came to a plain at the foot of a
mountain, where he encountered a hermit, and begged the holy man for
leave to remain with him. The hermit greeted him kindly, and Amadis
confided his history to the good old man, who told him that he dwelt on
a high rock full seven leagues out at sea. And the hermit gave him the
name Beltenebros, or &lsquo;the Fair Forlorn,&rsquo; as he was at once
so comely and so sore distracted.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e2924" class="main">The Poor Rock</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In due time they reached the sea-shore, and, giving
his horse to the mariners, Amadis accompanied the hermit on board a
vessel and sailed to the Poor Rock, as the holy man had named his place
of hermitage. And here Amadis partook of the austerities of the hermit,
&ldquo;not for devotion but for despair, forgetting his great renown in
arms and hoping and expecting death&mdash;all for the anger of a
woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Durin, Oriana&rsquo;s messenger, journeyed back to the British Court
and told his mistress how Amadis had received her letter, and of the
manner in which her knight had achieved the adventure of the Firm
Island. Then Oriana knew that Amadis must have remained true to her.
When she learned that he had gone into the desert to die, her shame and
anguish knew no bounds, and she wrote a letter of deep contrition to
her lover, and dispatched it to him by one of her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>women called &lsquo;the Damsel of
Denmark,&rsquo; a sister of Durin.</p>
<p>After they had set out, the knight whom Amadis had vanquished on the
evening of the day on which he learned of Oriana&rsquo;s cruelty
arrived at the British Court, bringing with him the armour of Amadis,
which he had found, some time after his encounter with him, at the edge
of a deep fountain. And when she heard his story Oriana believed her
lover to be dead, and in great grief shut herself in her apartments,
refusing all comfort.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, calling to mind the great misery he had endured, Amadis
made this song in his passion:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Farewell to victory,</p>
<p class="line">To warlike glory and to knightly play.</p>
<p class="line">Ah, wherefore should I live to weep and sigh?</p>
<p class="line">Far greater honour would it be to die!</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">With kindly death my wretchedness shall cease,</p>
<p class="line">And from my torments shall I find release.</p>
<p class="line">Love will be unremembered in the shade,</p>
<p class="line">The deep unkindness of a cruel maid,</p>
<p class="line">Who in her pride hath slain not me alone,</p>
<p class="line">But all the deeds for glory I have done!<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e2959src" href="#xd19e2959" name=
"xd19e2959src">6</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">At this time the lady Corisanda, who loved Florestan,
chanced to visit the Poor Rock, and her damsels heard the story of
Amadis, who told them that his name was Beltenebros, but that the song
had been made by one Amadis, whom he had known. On her return to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>British Court, Corisanda&rsquo;s maidens sang
the song to Oriana as the composition of Amadis. And she knew that
Amadis and Beltenebros were one and the same.</p>
<p>Now the Damsel of Denmark, who had been sent to search for Amadis,
was driven by tempest to the foot of the Poor Rock.<a class="noteref"
id="xd19e2970src" href="#xd19e2970" name="xd19e2970src">7</a> Landing
with Durin and an attendant, Enil, she found Amadis praying in the
chapel, and when he beheld the Damsel&rsquo;s face he fainted away.</p>
<p>This extreme sensitiveness to love is characteristic of the late
Middle Ages, however absurd and overdrawn it may appear to us. That
Amadis fainted at the mere sight of one who had served his lady seems
to us ridiculous, and that he should imprison himself upon a barren
rock for the remainder of his life because she had been unkind to him
is to the modern reader more than a little grotesque.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Shall I, wasting in despair,</p>
<p class="line">Die because a woman&rsquo;s fair?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But we must deal gently with the ideas of the past, as
with one of those faded samplers of our great-grandmothers, which, if
we handle it carelessly, is apt to fall to pieces. When we think of the
manner in which Dante and Petrarch had established the worship of
woman, and how the Courts of Love had completed the work they had
begun, can we wonder that men bred in this creed, and regarding the
worship of womankind as second to that of God alone, were apt to become
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>disconsolate and despairing if the object of
their devotion condemned or deserted them? Again, exalted and sensitive
minds in all ages have been peculiarly amenable to feminine criticism,
as we can see in perusing the biographies of such men as Goethe.
Genius, too, which itself nearly always abundantly partakes of the
nature of the feminine, is prone to adopt this ultra-reverent attitude,
as the sonnets of Shakespeare and the poems of Lovelace and many
another singer show. The rough, manly common sense of the average male
is too often denied it, and, man and woman in itself, it must suffer
the emotions of both sexes.</p>
<p>But, if maintained within rational bounds, this reverence for women
in general and for the best type of woman in particular must be
regarded as one of the great binding forces of humanity, a thing which
has accomplished perhaps more than aught else for the world&rsquo;s
refinement and advance. And here, even in a work of romance, which
perhaps, after all, is the fitting place for such an exhortation, I
would appeal to the younger generation of to-day to look backward with
eyes of kindness upon the tender beauty and infinite charm of a creed
which, if it is not entirely dead, is in a manner moribund. I do not
ask our youths and maidens to imitate its fantastic features or its
extravagances. But I do entreat them to regard its fine spirit, its
considerate chivalry, and, above all, the modest reserve and lofty
intention which were its chief characteristics. It is a good sign of
the times that the sexes are growing to know each other better. But we
must be wary of the familiarity that breeds contempt. Let us retain a
little more of the serious beauty of the old intercourse between man
and woman, and learn to beware of a flippancy of attitude and laxity of
demeanour which in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120"
name="pb120">120</a>]</span>later years we shall certainly look back
upon with a good deal of vexation and self-reproach.</p>
<p>When he had regained consciousness, the Damsel of Denmark gave
Amadis Oriana&rsquo;s letter, beseeching him to return to her and
receive her atonement for the wrong she had done him. He took leave of
the good hermit, and, embarking upon the ship in which the Damsel had
arrived, set sail for the Firm Island, where he rested, as he was yet
too weak to make the long journey to England. But at the end of ten
days he took Enil for his squire and, accompanied by Durin and the
Damsel, set out for the English Court.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Meanwhile Galaor, Florestan, and Agrayes, having
searched in vain for Amadis, arrived at London in a most disconsolate
frame of mind. Oriana, hearing of their want of success, betook her to
the castle of Miraflores, some leagues from the city. In its ancient
garden she came to feel that Amadis was still alive, and, full of
remorse for the manner in which she had dealt with him, she resolved
that no further shadow should fall upon their love. The description of
Miraflores in the romance is very beautiful, and the impression we
receive of Oriana walking in its quiet and umbrageous alleys may
perhaps best be rendered in verse.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Miraflores, fountain-girded,</p>
<p class="line">Where the trees are many-birded,</p>
<p class="line">And the orchard and the garden</p>

<p class="line">In this fair and fragrant place;</p>
<p class="line">May I know the bliss of pardon</p>
<p class="line">In thy battlemented garden;</p>
<p class="line">Come to hate the hate of scorning,</p>
<p class="line">And to love the love of grace!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now a herald came to King Lisuarte at Windsor giving
him defiance in the name of Famongomadan, the giant, Cartadaque, his
nephew, giant of the Defended Mountain, and Madanfaboul, giant of the
Vermilion Tower; from Quadragante, brother of King Abies of Ireland,
and Archelaus the Enchanter, all of whom were to join against Britain
on behalf of King Cildadan<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3033src" href=
"#xd19e3033" name="xd19e3033src">8</a> of Ireland, who had quarrelled
with Lisuarte. The knight, however, made one condition which he said
would ensure peace, and that degrading enough. For he announced that,
should Lisuarte give his daughter Oriana as damsel and servant to
Madasima, the daughter of Famongomadan, or in marriage to Basagante,
his son, the allied giants and kings would not advance against him, but
would remain in their own lands. Lisuarte rejected the proffered terms
with quiet dignity.</p>
<p>Now Amadis had slain King Abies long before, and it was revenge
against him the ill-assorted allies desired, and Florestan, who was
present, hearing this, challenged the ambassador to battle. This the
knight, whose name was Landin, promised him on the completion of the
war, and they exchanged gages of battle.</p>
<p>When the knight had departed, Lisuarte called for his little
daughter Leonora to come with her damsels and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>dance before him, a thing he had not done since
the news that Amadis was lost. And he asked her to sing a song which
Amadis, in sport, had made for her. So the child and her companions
made music and chanted this little lay:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">White rosebud, Leonore,</p>
<p class="line">Unblemished flower,</p>
<p class="line">Pure as a morning in the fields of May,</p>

<p class="line">Why dost thou bloom apart,</p>
<p class="line">Hid in the shadows of thy modesty?</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Or, if thou mayst not be,</p>

<p class="first">Gandalin journeyed to Miraflores to acquaint Oriana
with the news that Corisanda had arrived at Court and had been reunited
to Florestan. Delighted as she was at this intelligence, she could not
help comparing the happy condition of the lovers with her own, and
burst into tears. But even as she wept the Damsel of Denmark was
announced. Oriana listened to her tidings with a beating heart, and
when the Damsel gave her a letter from Amadis, in which she found his
ring enclosed, she all but swooned with excess of joy.</p>
<p>Amadis lay in a distant nunnery, recovering from the wasting sorrow
from which he had suffered so long. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>When he felt
stronger, he donned green armour, so that he might not be known, and
travelled toward London. On the eighth day of his journey he
encountered the giant knight Quadragante, he who among others had
defied King Lisuarte. Amadis unhorsed the gigantic warrior, who yielded

<h3 id="xd19e3081" class="main">Amadis Slays Famongomadan</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Proceeding on his way, Amadis passed some tents
pitched in a meadow which were occupied by a party of knights and
damsels in the service of the Princess Leonora. The knights insisted
upon his breaking a lance with them. He unhorsed them all and rode on.
While he was in the act of drinking from a well not many miles farther
on, he espied a wagon full of captive knights and damsels in chains.
Before it, on a huge black horse, rode a giant so immense that he was
terrible to behold, and Amadis knew him for Famongomadan, who had sent
his challenge to Lisuarte. Amadis, who was much wearied by his recent
encounter with the knights, did not then desire to meet him, but when
he saw that Leonora was in the wagon along with the other damsels he
leapt on his destrier and, looking toward Miraflores, where Oriana was,
awaited the giant&rsquo;s onset.</p>
<p>Seeing him, Famongomadan thundered down upon him like a human
avalanche. His great boar-spear transfixed Amadis&rsquo;s horse, but
the lance of the paladin ran its way clean through the monster&rsquo;s
carcass and broke off short in his body. At this his son Basagante ran
to the rescue, but Amadis, disengaging himself from his fallen steed,
drew his sword and severed one of Basagante&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>legs
from the trunk. But his falchion snapped in twain with the violence of
the blow, and a fierce struggle for Basagante&rsquo;s axe ended in
Amadis wrenching it from his opponent&rsquo;s grasp and smiting off his
head. Then he slew Famongomadan with his own spear, and, releasing the
knights in the wagon, requested them to carry the bodies of the dead
<span class="corr" id="xd19e3089" title="Source: gaints">giants</span>
to King Lisuarte and say that they were sent by a strange knight,
Beltenebros. And mounting the great black horse of Famongomadan, he
galloped off.</p>
<p>At long last Amadis came to Miraflores and met with Oriana, and
great was the love between them. Eight days he sojourned in the castle
with his lady; then he rode away to assist Lisuarte in his war against
Cildadan of Ireland, who, as we have seen, had challenged the
King&rsquo;s supremacy in Britain. Cildadan and his giant allies were
vanquished and the Irish king sorely wounded by Amadis.</p>
<p>Now Briolania, the lady from whom Amadis had received the broken
sword, visited Oriana, and told her in confidence that she was
enamoured of Amadis, who on his part had told her that he loved her
not, whereat Oriana was both relieved and not a little amused. And now
the whole Court knew that Beltenebros and Amadis were one and the same,
and great was the wonder at the puissance of his single arm.</p>
<p>But Amadis, who knew that adventure was the duty and lot of a
knight, desired once more to go in quest of it, and with him went ten
knights, his friends and kinsmen, greatly to the discontent of
Lisuarte, whom mischief-makers tried to incense against Amadis, for
removing the best and bravest of his Court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Briolania had betaken herself to the Firm <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>Island, where she was much disturbed by signs
and portents of a very terrible nature. She passed between the Arch of
True Lovers. But when she attempted to penetrate to the Forbidden
Chamber she was violently cast out. So, sad at heart, she returned to
her own country. Shortly after this Amadis arrived at the island,
greatly to the joy of all therein.</p>
<p>Here we learn something further regarding the topography and natural
history of the Firm Island, which was nine leagues long and seven wide,
full of villages and rich dwelling-houses. Apolidon had built himself
four wonderful palaces in the isle. One was that of the Serpent and the
Lions, another that of the Hart and the Dogs. The third was called the
Whirling Palace, for three times a day, and as often in the night, it
whirled round, so that they who were in it thought it would be dashed
to pieces. The fourth was that of the Bull, because every day a wild
bull issued out of an old covered way and ran among the people as
though he would destroy them. Then he entered a tower, from which he
emerged ridden by an aged ape, which flogged him back to the place
whence he had come.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e3104src" href=
"#xd19e3104" name="xd19e3104src">10</a></p>
<p>News reached the island that Gromadaza of the Boiling Lake, the wife
of Famongomadan, had sent her defiance to Lisuarte, who in consequence
had resolved to behead her daughter Madasima and other damsels of the
race of giants unless she gave up her castles and yielded her kingdom
to him. Amadis and his knights thought it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>ill in Lisuarte to
take such measures against women, and dispatched twelve of their number
to act as champions to the distressed giantesses. This action naturally
gave colour to the stories of the mischief-makers at Lisuarte&rsquo;s
Court, who desired to put Amadis to shame. But Lisuarte was of too
noble a mind to listen to them, and on the arrival of the knights he
set the damsels free.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd19e3111" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3112" class="main">Amadis Quarrels with Lisuarte</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But Fate and the counsels of wicked men are often
stronger than the nobility of kings. His advisers urged Lisuarte to
attempt the siege of the Island of Mongaza, the last stronghold of the
giants, and held only by their womenkind. Amadis and his company
conceived this proposal as unchivalrous, and when Lisuarte heard of
their opinion he grew wroth and sent his defiance to Amadis in the Firm
Island. Amadis replied that Madasima, the daughter of Famongomadan,
having wed with Galvanes, a friend of both Lisuarte and himself, the
island could not be held as sheltering the enemies of Lisuarte any
longer, and that he would defend it with his whole force. And he set
sail for the island with a large and well-equipped army. There they
found a garrison which had taken possession in the name of Lisuarte,
and which they dispossessed.</p>
<p>Leaving a suitable force in the island, Amadis, who was becoming
anxious regarding Oriana, set sail for his own land of Gaul, and,
putting in at an island for supplies, chanced then to rescue his
brother Galaor and King Cildadan from the clutches of a tyrannous
giant, who had entrapped them. Arrived in Gaul, Amadis greeted his
parents, whom he had not seen for some years. In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>the
meantime Lisuarte had himself landed in the Isle of Mongaza, and had
defeated the troops of Galvanes, its rightful lord, but he dealt
reasonably and kindly with his vanquished foes and contented himself
with making Galvanes, and Madasima, his wife, do homage to him.</p>
<p>For some time Amadis led a life of ease, hunting and feasting, and
contenting himself with such news of his lady as he could obtain. We
are told that by these means his great renown became obscured, although
the unbiased reader might think that he had already achieved sufficient
fame to last a lifetime. &ldquo;Damsels who went to him to seek revenge
for their wrongs cursed him for forsaking arms in the best of his
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Amadis had strong reasons for acting as he did, for a letter
from Oriana had informed him that she had borne him a little son, and
she beseeched him not to leave Gaul until such time as he heard further
from her. She did not acquaint him with the circumstance that the
infant had been lost, but of this we shall hear more anon. Later Oriana
wrote desiring Amadis not to take arms against her father, and not to
quit Gaul, unless it were to take his part. So Amadis resolved to
assist Lisuarte against the Kings of the Isles, with whom he was about
to do battle, and who had invaded his kingdom.</p>
<p>Now the Damsel of Denmark had taken the little son of Amadis and
Oriana and had carried him by night through a gloomy forest, in order
that her mistress might not be disgraced. Left alone for a moment, the
child had been carried off by a lioness, from which it had been rescued
by a hermit, Nasciano, who had called him Esplandian, and educated him
along with his own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128"
name="pb128">128</a>]</span>nephew. The good man brought the lads up as
hunters, and not the least strange thing about this remarkable child
was the circumstance that a lioness had affectionately attached herself
to him, refusing to leave him, either when at home or in the chase.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Amadis, calling himself &lsquo;Knight of the Green
Sword,&rsquo; had resolved to do away with the ill reports of his
unchivalrous sloth. Taking only Ardian the dwarf with him, he entered
Germany, where he passed four years in adventure without word or
message from Oriana. Passing into Bohemia, he remained at its Court for
a space.</p>
<p>One day Lisuarte, going to the chase with the Queen and his
daughters, came to the mountain where the hermit Nasciano dwelt, and
encountering Esplandian, resolved to adopt him, and the hermit showed
him a letter, written by Urganda, which had been tied to
Esplandian&rsquo;s neck when Nasciano found him. The letter was
addressed to King Lisuarte himself, and advised him to cherish the boy,
who one day would deliver him from the greatest danger. So Lisuarte
resolved to attach Esplandian, and Sargil, his foster-brother, to his
service. And when the hermit told how he had rescued Esplandian from
the lioness Oriana knew him to be none other than her own son, for she
had heard that the infant left on the threshold of the nunnery had been
seized by a wild beast and carried off.</p>
<p>In the course of his adventures, which were numerous and stirring,
Amadis was sorely wounded by a monster which he had slain, and was
cured of his hurt by a certain lady called Grasinda, to whom he was
grateful for her kindness and assistance, and he promised to do her
will in any adventure she might choose for him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>About the same time El Patin, Emperor of Rome, resolved to ask King
Lisuarte for the hand of Oriana. Hearing this, Queen Sardamira of
Sardinia, who loved El Patin, came to Britain along with the
ambassadors of the Roman Emperor, and, meeting Oriana, gave her some
account of Amadis, telling her how on one occasion he had conquered El
Patin in battle and how that emperor owed him a mortal grudge.</p>
<p>Galaor, who suspected the love of Amadis and Oriana, went to
Lisuarte, strongly advising him not to give Oriana in marriage to the
Emperor, and set out for Gaul, hoping to receive some news of Amadis.
At the same time Florestan betook himself to the Firm Island, to
acquaint Agrayes of the troubles besetting Oriana, and to carry him
news of his lady Mabilia, who longed to see him once more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd19e3139" class="div2 section"><span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3140" class="main">&lsquo;The Greek Knight&rsquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But, as fortune would have it, Amadis, now calling
himself &lsquo;the Greek Knight,&rsquo; accompanied by the lady
Grasinda, arrived in Britain. Amadis, desiring to remain
<i>incognito</i>, gave explicit orders to all in his train not to
divulge his name. He learned that Oriana was about to be given to the
Emperor, and resolved to take his measures accordingly. Grasinda,
however, mindful of his vow to her to embark in any adventure she might
choose for him, sent a letter to King Lisuarte stating that she held
herself fairer than any lady at his Court, and that did any knight deny
this he must do battle with her champion, the Greek Knight. The Roman
ambassadors requested of Lisuarte that they might be permitted to take
up the challenge, and to this he acceded. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>The combat duly took place between Amadis and the knights of Rome,
to the entire discomfiture of the latter. But the day came on which
Lisuarte had promised the Emperor to send Oriana to him, and although
she swooned at the thought of being taken to Rome, her stubborn father
had her carried on board ship, said farewell to her, not unkindly, and
watched the Roman galley as it bore his daughter from the white shores
of Britain.</p>
<p>Amadis, hearing of the King&rsquo;s intention, went on board his own
ship, and lay in wait for the Roman vessel which was carrying off his
adored lady. Attacking the Italian craft with impetuosity, he quickly
overcame those on board, rescued Oriana, and at once set sail with her
for the golden shores of the Firm Island.</p>
<p>After a voyage of seven days the vessel of Amadis anchored in the
haven of the Firm Island. The lady Grasinda had by this time arrived
there, and now came out to welcome Oriana, whom of all ladies in the
world she most desired to see, because of her great renown, which was
everywhere spread abroad. And when she beheld Oriana &ldquo;she could
not believe that such beauty was possible in any mortal
creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oriana and the other ladies were lodged in a tower of the palace
wrought by the magic skill of Apolidon, and by her request no knight
was permitted to enter this tower till some terms might be made with
the King, her father. Amadis was well aware that the defiance he had
thrown in the teeth of Lisuarte and the Emperor of Rome by his
abduction of Oriana must lead to serious consequences, so he dispatched
messengers to his many friends throughout the world asking that they
would send succour to him in his necessity. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>The enmity which had arisen betwixt his two ancient enemies, Amadis
and King Lisuarte, presented an opportunity to the wily enchanter
Archelaus which he had no intention of letting slip. He therefore
approached several other spirits of discord and proposed to them that
if strife commenced between Amadis and the British King they with their
forces should conceal themselves in the neighbourhood of the
engagement, and when one side or the other had achieved victory, they
should fall upon the remnants of both armies and overwhelm them in a
common ruin. This dastardly plan commended itself to the malcontent
lords and petty kings to whom the wizard proposed it, and they resolved
to carry it into effect.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3160" class="main">War with Lisuarte</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Meanwhile Amadis had dispatched an embassy to the
Court of Lisuarte, requesting the hand of Oriana, but the stubborn old
monarch gave a stern refusal and sent him his defiance. El Patin,
Emperor of Rome, had by this time arrived in Britain, and was busy
concerting measures against Amadis. Soon a mighty host was gathered
together, and marched to seek the army of Amadis, who, taking time by
the forelock, had invaded Britain, and now advanced to meet the forces
of Lisuarte and the Emperor.</p>
<p>The friends of Amadis had not failed him. In the first place his
father, King Perion, was behind him with the whole force of Gaul.
Ireland had sent a large contingent, and his old friends, the King of
Bohemia and the Emperor of Constantinople, had furnished him with
well-equipped legions, all of which were under the skilled leadership
of King Perion. Moreover, the army <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132"
href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>was accompanied by Oriana,
Grasinda, and the other dames and princesses who had come to the Firm
Island, and their presence heartened the champions to deeds of high
emprise. Meanwhile Archelaus the enchanter and his allies dogged the
progress of Lisuarte&rsquo;s forces in the hope of taking them at a
disadvantage.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e3169width" id="p132"><img src="images/p132.jpg"
alt="The Proud Circumstance of Chivalry" width="494" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">The Proud Circumstance of Chivalry</p>
</div>
<p>Presently the armies came within sight of one another. Their
meeting-place was a great plain, and for miles nothing was to be seen
but the blaze of armour and gay surcoats, the waving of plumes and
banners, and all the proud circumstance of chivalry. For two days the
armies lay in sight of one another. Then they advanced to the charge
with such a tumult of drums and cymbals, trumpets and clarions that it
could be heard many a league away. They met with a crash like thunder,
and the noise which arose from the clash of swords upon armour was like
that of a thousand hammers upon as many anvils.</p>
<p>Amadis led the van. Challenged by Gasquilan, the haughty King of
Sweden, he charged him, and dashed him from the saddle with such force
that he lay as dead. But in the encounter Amadis fell from his horse.
Quadragante, who was close to him, unhorsed a Roman knight, and gave
his destrier to the steedless hero, who, followed by Gandalin and other
paladins, attacked the flank of the Romans with great fierceness.
Meanwhile Quadragante did fearful execution on their front, few of the
enemy being able to withstand his giant might for long.</p>
<p>The Roman army now showed signs of falling into confusion, but at
that moment the Emperor came up with a reinforcement of five thousand
men. He headed the charge in person, crying, &ldquo;Rome! Rome!&rdquo;
and brandishing a great sword in his hand. Encountering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>Quadragante, he received such a buffet from the
giant knight as made him give back and seek shelter among his own
men.</p>
<p>Now Amadis, surrounded by his bravest paladins, performed deeds of
valour which were a wonder in the eyes of both friends and enemies. The
Romans began to give ground before the terrific blows he dealt on all
sides, and at last broke and fled. So greatly had his forces suffered,
however, that he refrained from pursuing his beaten enemies, and as yet
the army of Lisuarte had taken no part in the fighting, so that he
thought it better to spare his own men, who must meet Lisuarte&rsquo;s
force anon.</p>
<p>On the following day King Lisuarte marshalled his army, and now King
Perion came up with his forces, which had been held in reserve. The
battle had not been long in progress, however, when Amadis encountered
the Roman Emperor, and with such a blow as even he had seldom delivered
ended his career. When the Romans and Britons saw that their leader was
slain they began to give way, and Lisuarte, observing this, sought to
withdraw his men in good order. Seeing that he retreated, and fearing
for Lisuarte&rsquo;s personal safety, Amadis took advantage of the
darkness which was now falling to withdraw his troops rather than
pursue, so that the King was able to effect an orderly retiral.</p>
<p>When the holy hermit Nasciano heard of the great discord between the
kings he resolved to make an endeavour to prevent further slaughter,
and although he was old and infirm he succeeded in making his way to
the camp of King Lisuarte. He did not arrive, however, until the two
battles which have just been described had been fought. Making himself
known to the King, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>revealed to him that Oriana had
promised marriage to Amadis and that Esplandian was their son. On
hearing this the King was greatly troubled, and blamed the lovers for
their secrecy, remarking, with justice, that many valuable lives would
have been spared had they seen fit to trust him. He requested the
hermit to approach Amadis with a view to the conclusion of peace
between them, and this the good man was only too pleased to do.
Accompanied by Esplandian, he betook himself to the camp of Amadis,
where he was courteously received. The hermit first revealed
Esplandian&rsquo;s identity to the boy&rsquo;s father, and Amadis
cordially embraced his son. But he did not forget his pacific mission.
Before he left Amadis he had smoothed over all the differences between
him and the proud old King Lisuarte, and it was arranged that their
ambassadors should meet, with the object of cementing a generous and
lasting peace.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3191" class="main">The Treachery of Archelaus</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Meanwhile the vindictive enchanter Archelaus, with his
malcontent associates, had been anxiously watching the trend of
affairs, and when their spies informed them that hostilities were at an
end between Lisuarte and Amadis they resolved to attack the old
King&rsquo;s forces without delay. But the sight of their army on the
march was witnessed by Esplandian as he was returning to
Lisuarte&rsquo;s headquarters, and he hastily retraced his steps to the
camp of Amadis to warn him that treachery was on foot. On learning his
tidings Amadis and King Perion at once set out to rescue
Lisuarte&rsquo;s exhausted forces from the danger which menaced them.
But before Amadis and his knights could come up with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>the
army of Archelaus, Lisuarte and his remaining squadrons had been
attacked by the troops of the wizard and his allies, who had inflicted
upon them a crushing defeat. The aged monarch was compelled to escape
as best he could from the stricken field, and, seeking refuge in a
neighbouring town, prepared for a last desperate defence against his
implacable enemies. The place was fiercely attacked by Archelaus, and
as fiercely defended by Lisuarte and such knights as remained to him.
But as the sorcerer was on the point of taking the town by storm Amadis
and his paladins appeared, and routed him after a sanguinary struggle.
Archelaus and his associates were bound in chains, and were rather
foolishly released upon giving security for their future good
behaviour.</p>
<p>The meeting of Lisuarte and Amadis was cordial in the extreme, and
it was apparent that their old friendship would speedily be renewed.
Lisuarte summoned his barons and nobles together, and when they had all
assembled publicly announced the espousal of Amadis and Oriana.</p>
<p>Now the whole company, including Lisuarte, Perion, and their queens,
Florestan, Galaor, Agrayes, and many others, journeyed to the Firm
Island, where it was unanimously considered that the nuptials of Amadis
and Oriana might most appropriately take place. On their arrival at
that enchanted spot princely preparations were made to mark the event
in a manner befitting such an occasion, for not only were Amadis and
Oriana at last to be united, but numbers of their friends were to take
upon them the vows of marriage at the same time. In the midst of the
preparations the beneficent sorceress Urganda made her appearance,
riding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>upon a great dragon, and was affectionately
welcomed by those over whose fortunes she had so diligently
presided.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3204" class="main">The Wedding of Amadis and Oriana</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When all was ready and the day of the wedding had at
last arrived, a brilliant assembly mounted their palfreys and proceeded
to the church, where the hermit Nasciano<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e3208src" href="#xd19e3208" name="xd19e3208src">11</a> celebrated
Mass. When the ceremony had duly been performed, Amadis asked of
Lisuarte that ere the revels began Oriana might be permitted to make
test of the adventure of the Arch of True Lovers, as the enchantment
still held good so far as ladies were concerned. To this the King gave
his consent. As Oriana approached the image raised its trumpet and blew
such a strain of sweetness as had never yet been heard in the island,
and from the mouth of the trumpet fell flowers and roses in such
abundance that they covered the ground. Without any hesitation Oriana
passed on to the adventure of the Forbidden Chamber. As she passed
between the pillars she felt hands invisible violently pushing her
backward, and three times did they thrust her past the pillars. But by
reason of her surpassing faithfulness and beauty she won, despite
opposition, to the enchanted portal, where the hand which had admitted
Amadis was thrust out, and she entered the chamber, while the voices of
viewless singers softly chanted the praises of her beauty and
constancy.</p>
<p>Now all the assembled company who had beheld this last marvel
entered the chamber, and the marriage feast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>was
spread therein. The long endurance of Amadis and Oriana was over, and
at length united to each other and to their son Esplandian they looked
forward to an existence of such happiness as is only vouchsafed to
mortals in the unclouded pages of old romance.</p>
<p>So ends this brave old tale, in which we read of manners and modes
of thought so widely removed from those of our own time as almost to
appear like those of the people of another planet. The conduct of
knight and damsel is, perhaps, a little strained. No matter how absurd
a promise or fantastic the circumstances in which it was extracted, it
is still regarded as binding, and if we admire the romantic nature of
such a code we are tempted to smile at the seriousness with which
bearded knights and all-powerful monarchs give way before the quibble
of magicians whose lures and devices would be laughed at by a modern
schoolboy. Nevertheless, in perusing the story we experience a strong
conviction of its author&rsquo;s purity of soul and integrity of
purpose.</p>
<p>From the reader who has followed me through the mazes of this
enchanting romance I must ask pardon for having omitted in my rendering
of it many passages of rare beauty and touching humanity. My business
in this volume, however, is to present the thread of the story, to
describe its main incidents, and, keeping as closely as possible to the
adventures and doings of its principal characters, to supply an outline
of the whole. I might readily have enhanced the brilliancy and
readableness of my account if I had chosen to narrate isolated
adventures and the incidents of more surpassing excellence with which
it teems. But my purpose, as I have said, is to provide readers who
have little time to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138"
name="pb138">138</a>]</span>peruse an original text with the story in
brief. At the same time I have attempted to conserve the true spirit of
the romance, and if I have failed to do so that must in some measure be
attributed to the difficult task of compression with which I was
confronted. In the words of one who &lsquo;set&rsquo; <i>Amadis</i> to
verse, I may say, with justice:</p>

I can see in this giant Albadan the giant Albiona, one of the two
monsters, sons of Neptune, who, according to Pomponius Mela, attacked
Hercules in Liguria. The name Albion was once given to the whole of
Britain, and later, as Alba and Albany, to Scotland, whose people were
known as Albannach. This is said to mean &lsquo;the White,&rsquo; in
allusion to the cliffs of Dover! It is much more probable that it
signified &lsquo;the place or region of the god Alba,&rsquo; &lsquo;the
country of the white god.&rsquo; All the Scottish gods were giants,
like the Fomorians of Ireland.</p>

Theseus, Arthur, and many another hero. On this head see Hartland,

as Southey remarks, is a true fairy, resembling Morgan le Fay in her
attributes, but, as Scott says, she has no connexion with the more

identical with Morgan, and her name merely a Hispanic rendering of the
Celtic fairy&rsquo;s?</p>

Munday&rsquo;s translation of these verses in his <i>Amadis</i>, and
with justice. The above translation is only slightly more tolerable,
but it is at least sense. Poor Tony was bitten by the absurdities of
euphuism, and his lines are mere nonsense. But there is even less
excuse for a modern translation to backslide into the style of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<h2 id="xd19e3247" class="main">Chapter IV: The Sequels to
&ldquo;Amadis de Gaul&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="epigraph">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Inferior as these after-books of <i>Amadis</i>
certainly are, they form so singular an epoch in the history of
literature that an abridgment of the whole series into our language is
to be desired.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Southey</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In dealing with the literatures of the Peninsula, a
task for which he was eminently well equipped, Southey followed an
instinct of natural discrimination which seldom played him false.
Feeble as some of the &lsquo;after-books&rsquo; of <i>Amadis</i>
undoubtedly are, we cannot afford to ignore them, if only because of
the literary phenomena they present. In these fantastic tales the
imagination which had flowered so luxuriantly in <i>Amadis</i> became
overblown. They are, indeed, the petals fallen from the fading
rose&mdash;so quickly did the wonderful blossom of chivalric fiction
droop and wither.</p>
<p>The first of these sequels, called <i>The Fifth Book of Amadis</i>,
is more generally known as <i>Esplandian</i>, as it chiefly refers to
the adventures of that hero. Cervantes is, perhaps, rather more unkind
to this romance than its peculiar merits deserve, for he makes his
critical curate say of it: &ldquo;Verily the father&rsquo;s goodness
shall not excuse the want of it in the son. Here, good mistress
housekeeper, open that window and throw it into the yard. Let it serve
as a foundation to that pile which we are to set a-blazing
presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first edition of <i>Esplandian</i> was published at Seville in
1542. The greater part of it seems to have been composed by Montalvo,
the original translator of <i>Amadis</i>. But whereas when he penned
that work he acted the part of a translator only, in <i>Esplandian</i>
he undertook the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of authorship proper, and that he
failed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>discern the wide distinctions which separate
these tasks is rather painfully apparent. It seems to me, however, a
mistaken criticism which brands <i>Esplandian</i> as entirely lacking
in merit, and I suspect that more than one of the censorious folk who
have thus entreated it have not perused it in the original, or have
merely taken Cervantes&rsquo; word regarding its lack of quality. It is
notorious that many English critics seem to believe it possible to pass
a verdict upon works written in Spanish without possessing more than a
nodding acquaintance with the language, and the absurd idea obtains
among many men of letters, who ought to know better, that, given a
knowledge of Latin and French, the acquisition of the Castilian tongue
is merely a matter of a little reading.</p>
<p><i>Esplandian</i> possesses many quaint beauties, and the fairy
&lsquo;machinery&rsquo; and rather distinguished simplicity of its
atmosphere make it most pleasant and delectable to peruse. Where, too,
may we encounter a better or more representative example of romantic
extravagance at its best?&mdash;for <i>Esplandian</i>, without
exhibiting the grosser faults of its descendants, has the rich and
varied colour of that imaginative excess which is the birthright of all
true poets, and in the discipline of which all are not successful. I
quite admit, however, that <i>Esplandian</i> is food for the
enthusiast, and I do not recommend its perusal to unromantic souls. It
is not for the barbers and curates of this world, and pity &rsquo;tis
that they who cannot appreciate its spirit should attempt to influence
others to its detriment.</p>
<p>Esplandian spent his childhood at the Court of his grandfather, King
Lisuarte, and had scarcely been knighted when he felt the call of high
adventure. His wishes in this respect were speedily gratified, for
shortly after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>the gilt spurs had been placed on his heels he
fell into a deep swoon, which seemed to portend enchantment of no
common order. As he slept, the people of the Firm Island, whence he had
journeyed to have knighthood conferred upon him, beheld a vast mountain
of fire approach the shore, from which issued the sylph-like form of
the enchantress Urganda the Unknown, sailing through the air upon the
back of an enormous dragon. Some time prior to these events Amadis, to
whose custody the malicious Archelaus had been entrusted, had
injudiciously released that firebrand of the magical world, only to
learn shortly afterward that the unscrupulous wizard had taken
advantage of his new-found liberty to work his wiles once more upon the
all too unsuspecting Lisuarte, who seemed incapable of profiting by
experience, and who now paid for his credulity by incarceration in the
deepest dungeons of the necromancer&rsquo;s castle. Urganda announced
to the distracted son-in-law that it would be necessary for Esplandian
to execute a mission of vengeance, and ere it was possible to question
her further she bore away the youth on the back of the winged monster
she bestrode.</p>
<p>The enchantress conveyed the sleeping Esplandian to a mysterious
vessel called the <i>Ship of the Great Serpent</i>, and on waking it
was with no little exaltation of spirit that he found himself on its
deck. As he was wafted across the smooth ocean he felt a thrill of
pleasure arising from the magical ease with which the enchanted galley
skimmed the waves. In time he beheld a rocky islet standing in the
midst of a forsaken sea, and going ashore he found it to be barren and
showing no other sign of habitation than a tall tower, which crowned
its topmost height. He climbed the eminence upon which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>it
stood, and discovered the ancient fortalice to be completely deserted.
Exploring its recesses, he observed a stone in which a richly
ornamented sword was firmly embedded, but as he attempted to grasp this
the air was rent by the bellowings of a frightful dragon, which
descended upon him with such velocity that ere he could prepare himself
for its onset it had coiled its enormous folds round his body in an
effort to break through the plates of his armour and crush him to
death. Man and monster wrestled to and fro in a death-grapple, and so
terrific were their exertions that the earth shook and the castle
rocked beneath them as they swayed and writhed in a deadly embrace. At
length Esplandian succeeded in freeing his right hand from the
dragon&rsquo;s encircling folds, and, drawing a magic sword which
Urganda had bestowed upon him, passed it through the monster&rsquo;s
scaly hide. Mortally wounded, the dragon relaxed its grip, and its huge
body became rigid in death. When he had assured himself that it was
quite dead, Esplandian quitted the castle and returned to the shore, a
weird light which came from the enchanted sword, which he had extracted
from the boulder, guiding his footsteps through the gathering dusk.</p>
<p>Re-embarking on the <i>Ship of the Great Serpent</i>, he was
speedily wafted to a rugged country known as the Forbidden Mountain, a
stronghold on the borders of Turkey and Greece. At a distance he
perceived a castle, and was making his way thither when he encountered
a hermit, who warned him to avoid it, and told him that a prince of
renown was imprisoned therein. At once it occurred to Esplandian that
this must be none other than Lisuarte, and the castle the stronghold of
the wicked Archelaus, and this surmise naturally made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>him
resolve to inquire into the character of the place. As he neared the
gate he saw that it was guarded by a giant sentinel, who, on espying
him, rushed at him fiercely, brandishing a formidable club. Avoiding
the onset of his gigantic adversary, Esplandian slew him with the sword
of power, and was about to enter the castle when he was suddenly
confronted by Archelaus in person. A bitterly contested struggle
ensued. The enchanter, enraged at the stripling&rsquo;s audacity in
seeking to probe the mysteries of his stronghold, and in the knowledge
that he came of the race of his detested enemy Lisuarte, attacked
Esplandian with great fury. But his blind rage could not avail against
the cooler courage of his youthful antagonist, who succeeded in
dispatching him with the magic sword, thus for ever putting an end to
his necromantic enormities. A nephew of the slain enchanter next
assaulted the young knight, but he too fell before the magic falchion
of Urganda. Next Arcobone, the mother of Archelaus, a witch deeply
versed in the mysteries of the occult arts, sought to vanquish him by
the force of her anathemas, but the powers of counter-charm concealed
in Esplandian&rsquo;s blade saved him from the fury of the dread sybil,
who felt herself bound to obey his behests. He commanded her to reveal
the place of Lisuarte&rsquo;s confinement, and had the satisfaction of
releasing his aged relative.</p>
<p>As Esplandian and Lisuarte were about to leave the island, the fleet
of Matroed, eldest son of Arcobone, arrived off its shores, and the
young hero found himself forced to do battle with a fresh enemy, for,
relying upon his ability to defeat such a youthful adversary with ease,
Matroed made the combat a strictly personal one, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>he
and Esplandian were engaged in deadly fight until the waning of the
sun. But at length the many wounds which the pagan warrior had received
forced him to discontinue the struggle, and he begged Esplandian to
permit him to die in peace. At this juncture a holy man arrived, and
the expiring heathen requested his blessing, which was piously
granted.</p>
<p>Assuming the name of &lsquo;the Black Knight,&rsquo; from the colour
of his armour, Esplandian now ruled in the Forbidden Mountain as lord
of the castle he had subdued. But he was not permitted to remain in
quiet for long, as the fortalice was speedily invested by Armato, the
Soldan of Turkey, with a great army. Attracting numerous followers to
himself, however, Esplandian defeated the paynims, and took their
sovereign prisoner. Encouraged by this success, he carried the war into
the heart of the Turkish dominions and captured the principal city.</p>
<p>Before entering upon his career of adventure Esplandian had met
Leonorina, daughter of the Emperor of Constantinople, of whom he had
become greatly enamoured, and during the course of his war with the
Turks he had dispatched many messengers to her, assuring her of his
undying affection. He now learned that she had taken umbrage at his
long absence, so, when the capital of Turkey had fallen to his sword,
he speedily set out for Constantinople. Arrived there, he purchased a
cedar chest of exquisite workmanship, which he entrusted to certain
messengers, commanding them to bear it to the lady. When she opened it
in the privacy of her own apartment, to her mingled confusion and
delight her long-absent lover himself emerged from its recesses. In
Spanish romance it is inevitable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145"
href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>that the loves of the hero
and heroine should remain unknown to the lady&rsquo;s relatives, not
only because this was demanded by the romantic susceptibilities of the
average Spanish reader, but because Spanish opinion would have been
seriously affronted by the idea of parental compliance in any
intercourse between the lovers prior to marriage, save of the most
formal kind. This sorry condition of affairs still obtains among the
middle and upper classes of Spain and Spanish America, and we can
scarcely suppress amusement when we hear of ardent youths unable to
converse confidentially with the maidens to whom they are formally
affianced otherwise than by assuming some ridiculous disguise, or
through the kind offices of servants. Not infrequently young Spanish
couples whose engagement is quite <i lang="fr">en r&egrave;gle</i>, and
to whose union not the slightest opposition is made, arrange and carry
out an elopement, purely because of the romantic atmosphere surrounding
such a proceeding. It is circumstances such as these which enable us to
appreciate the firm hold of romance upon the Spanish heart.</p>
<p>But Esplandian had but little time for dalliance, as the Turks were
once more arrayed against him in the field. He had, however, a firm
ally in Urganda, but, to counterbalance this, the infidels were
supported by the enchantress Melia, the sister of Armato, the defeated
soldan, who had succeeded in making his escape upon the back of a
flying dragon, dispatched for that purpose by this Turkish witch. With
all speed he levied a large army, and set siege to Constantinople.
Numerous as the sands of the sea were his allies, one of whom was a
beautiful Amazonian queen, who brought with her to the scene of
hostilities a squadron of fifty griffins, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>flew
over the city much in the manner of devastating aircraft, belching fire
and smoke on the heads of the unhappy folk below.</p>
<p>So dire was the loss of life in this combat between the forces of
Christendom and paganism that at last it was agreed that the question
of pre-eminence should be settled by the issue of a double combat.
Amadis and Esplandian were selected on the one side, and the Amazon
queen and a celebrated pagan soldan on the other. The heathens were
defeated, but so enraged were they at their downfall that they rushed
to the attack with every available man (and woman) in their hosts. But
the Christians, mightily encouraged by the victory of their champions,
repulsed them with terrific loss, and drove them from the bounds of the
Grecian dominions. The Greek Emperor, probably only too happy to rid
himself of the burden of such a troublous inheritance, resigned his
crown to Esplandian, who espoused his Leonorina and settled down to the
task of governing the Hellenic realm.</p>
<p>Relieved from the pressure of military duties, in which she had
proved herself no inefficient ally, the sage Urganda had now leisure to
pay some attention to the private affairs of her mortal charges. On
consulting her magic mirror and other divinatory apparatus, she was
desolated to find that Amadis, Galaor, Esplandian, and indeed all of
her favourite champions, were soon to pay the debt of nature. Had her
prophetic soul been enabled to envisage the immensities of fiction to
which their future adventures were to give rise, she would undoubtedly
have allowed nature to take its course, so we must conclude that her
powers of vision were limited. Resolved to frustrate unkindly Fate, she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>summoned her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i> to
the Firm Island, and advised them, if they desired to escape mortality,
to obey the injunctions she would now place upon them. They anxiously
assured her that these would be carried out to the letter, and with the
best possible grace submitted to be cast into a magic sleep, from
which, it was decreed, they were not to awaken until disenchanted by
Lisuarte, son of Esplandian, who, on gaining possession of a certain
magic sword, would be enabled to bring them once more to life with
renewed vigour.</p>
<p>The Sixth Book of the <i>Amadis</i> series is concerned with the
adventures of Florisando, his nephew, but as its hero is not in the
line direct, and is, moreover, intolerably tiresome, we may well pass
him over with a mere mention of his existence.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3354" class="main">Lisuarte of Greece</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">More sprightly is Lisuarte of Greece, hero of the
seventh and eighth books, which are believed to have been written by
Juan Diaz, Bachelor of Canon Law, and published in 1526. Lisuarte is
not, however, the sole hero of this romance, Perion, a later son of
Amadis and Oriana, claiming a considerable share of the exploits which
fall to be recounted in the volume. This young warrior, hearing of the
prowess and address in arms of the King of Ireland, resolved to gratify
a desire to be knighted by him, and for this purpose embarked for the
Green Isle. While traversing St George&rsquo;s Channel, or its romantic
equivalent, he encountered a damsel cruising in a boat managed by four
apes. The animals begged Perion to accompany their mistress for the
fulfilment of a great enterprise, so, quitting his own vessel, he
embarked in the boat along with the apes <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>and the lady. His
attendants, chagrined by his acceptance of the adventure thus thrust
upon him, turned their vessel eastward and sailed on until they
eventually arrived at Constantinople, where they reported his virtual
disappearance, on learning of which his kinsman Lisuarte decided to go
in quest of him.</p>
<p>In the meantime young Perion had arrived with his strange
fellow-wanderers in the kingdom of Trebizond, which, as we are all
aware, is readily accessible from the Irish coast. In that city he had
seen and fallen in love with the daughter of the Emperor, but did not
have much leisure to pay his addresses to her, as the Lady of the Apes
rather unduly hurried him in the preliminaries of the task she had set
him. They had scarcely left Trebizond when Lisuarte arrived in the
city, and promptly fell in love with Onoloria, the Emperor&rsquo;s
remaining daughter. But one day, as the lovers were enjoying each
other&rsquo;s society, an enormous giantess entered the Court and
requested a boon from Lisuarte, which, in true romantic fashion, he
granted without inquiring its nature. It proved to be his attendance
for a year wherever the gigantic damsel chose to demand it. The
giantess was, indeed, a pagan spy, and had concocted this device to
withdraw Lisuarte, who was one of the great props of Christian Greece,
from the support of the Hellenic throne at a difficult and dangerous
time.</p>
<p>When Lisuarte had quitted Trebizond on the adventure in which he was
an unwilling partaker, the Emperor of that country, father of his
<i>inamorata</i>, was informed of the true character of the prodigious
damsel who had carried him off by a letter which was closed with
sixty-seven seals and which announced that Constantinople <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>was
about to be besieged by Armato, the Turkish Soldan, who had placed
himself at the head of a league of sixty-seven princes for the purpose
of waging war against the imperial city. Meanwhile Lisuarte was given
into the care of the King of the Giants&rsquo; Isle, whose daughter
Gradaffile fell in love with him, procured his escape, and followed him
to Constantinople, whence he at once betook himself for the purpose of
combating the infidels who invested it. In this task he was assisted by
Perion, who now arrived in Greece, after having accomplished the behest
of the Lady of the Apes.</p>
<p>In course of time Lisuarte became conscious that duty now called him
to effect the release of his sleeping ancestors from the spell in which
they had been cast for the purpose of prolonging their existences.
After many adventures, which we spare the reader, he obtained
possession of the fatal sword and proceeded to the Firm Island, where
he broke the enchanted sleep into which Amadis, Esplandian, and the
rest had been lulled by the far-sighted Urganda. These, naturally
refreshed by their long slumber, and longing for martial exercise, at
once assisted him in routing the pagan forces before Constantinople,
and achieving peace once more. Lisuarte, freed from his patriotic
labours, now bethought himself of his lady-love, and turned his steps
to the city of Trebizond. Perion had also gone thither from a similar
reason, but on the request of the Duchess of Austria had accompanied
that lady to her dominions, which were in the grip of a usurper. On his
return from this chivalrous task he encountered his kinsman Lisuarte,
and both champions were in the act of preparing their wedding
festivities when Perion and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150"
href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>Emperor of Trebizond were
carried off by pagan treachery in the midst of a hunting expedition.
Lisuarte, following on their track, was also seized by the enemy, and
imprisoned along with those he had sought to succour.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ninth Book carries on the adventures and exploits
of the race of Amadis, who in more senses than one may be said to be
immortal. It was first published in 1535 at Burgos, a place of many
literary associations, and purports to have been imitated in Latin from
the Greek, after the manner of the famous Troy romance <i>Dares and
Dictys</i>, and at a later time translated into the Romance language by
the potent and wise magician Alquife, evidently a supposititious Moor
pressed into the service of the most imaginative but undisciplined
writer who fabricated it. <i>Amadis of Greece</i>, indeed, approaches
the sublime of imaginative excess and fictional unreason, and in its
extravagant pages we are confronted with such a maze of marvel that to
provide an intelligent account of it is a task of no little
difficulty.</p>
<p>Following the wild career of the romancer with the halting step of
modern incredulity, we learn that Amadis of Greece was, like his
forbears, a child unwanted, the son of Lisuarte and Onoloria, Princess
of Trebizond, born shortly after the period of their interrupted
wedding. While the infant was being baptized at a fountain in a wild
and deserted place, to which he had been conveyed for the purposes of
secrecy, he was carried off by corsairs, who sold him to the Moorish
King of Saba. Distinguished by the representation of a sword upon his
breast, he adopted the name, when knighted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>by
the pagan monarch, of &lsquo;The Knight of the Flaming Sword.&rsquo;
Soon after he had entered the ranks of chivalry he was falsely accused
of cherishing a secret love for the Queen of Saba, and, dreading the
wrath of his benefactor, he made his escape, and embarked upon a career
of adventure&mdash;which, indeed, it would have been difficult for
anyone of his lineage to have avoided.</p>
<p>A pagan in religion and sentiment, he came to the vicinity of the
Forbidden Mountain which his grandfather had been instrumental in
liberating from the clutches of the infidel, and, reversing the pious
work then accomplished, he defeated and expelled those who held it for
the Emperor of Greece. Aroused by the menacing turn events had taken,
the great Esplandian himself, now Emperor of Constantinople, hastened
to the scene of hostilities and engaged in single combat with the
doughty new-comer, only, however, to suffer defeat at his hands, an
event which never could have entered into the calculation of the
enthusiastic author who composed the romance of that hero, who would
have been horrified at the mere thought of the eclipse of his
invincible &lsquo;star.&rsquo; Shortly after this Amadis encountered
the King of Sicily. Their acquaintance commenced with a combat, as it
was indeed essential that it should, as the only fitting means of
introduction between gentlemen of errant tendencies, but when they came
to know and esteem each other they patched up a comradeship which was
the more powerfully cemented by the passion of Amadis for the martial
monarch&rsquo;s lovely daughter.</p>
<p>In the course of his voyage to Sicily, Amadis chanced to visit an
island, where he found the Emperor of Trebizond, Lisuarte, Perion, and
Gradaffile in a state of enchanted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>slumber. As we have seen,
they had been spirited away by the emissaries of paganism. It chanced
that at this time Amadis of Gaul, who was evidently not yet too old for
adventurous pursuits, encountered the Queen of Saba, who was everywhere
searching for a champion to defend her against her husband&rsquo;s
false charges of conjugal infidelity. Amadis espoused her quarrel, and
accompanied her to Saba, where he did battle with and overcame her
accuser. He also succeeded in establishing her innocence, and that of
his namesake, Amadis of Greece, to the satisfaction of the King her
husband.</p>
<p>After he had freed his ancestors from their charmed sleep, Amadis of
Greece betook himself to Sicily. He had not been long in the island
when he heard a knight reciting amorous verses in the vicinity of the
palace. At once his jealous heart leapt to the conclusion that the
singer was chanting the praise of his princess. Almost crazed by his
suspicions, he searched everywhere for his supposed rival, but without
success, dogging his footsteps, but always failing to come up with him.
During this chase he met with many adventures. But at last he seems to
have convinced himself that his suspicions were groundless and that the
singer he had heard had had no designs upon the heart of his
<i>inamorata</i>.</p>
<p>Whilst these events were passing, Lisuarte, the father of our hero,
had returned to Trebizond, and had formally requested the hand of
Onoloria. But Zairo, Soldan of Babylon, had seen this princess in a
dream, and, accompanied by his sister Abra, had arrived at Trebizond to
demand her in marriage. The Emperor was quite prepared to grant his
suit, but not so Lisuarte, who had prior claims to the lady, and his
opposition so enraged the Soldan that he resorted to warlike measures
and set <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>siege to &ldquo;many-towered Trebizond.&rdquo;
After the siege had progressed for some time champions were selected
from either army to decide the pretensions of the rival parties. But
the Soldan&rsquo;s paladins were defeated by Gradaffile, daughter of
the King of the Giant&rsquo;s Isle, who disguised herself as a knight,
and whose Amazonian fury the unfortunate Babylonians could scarcely be
expected to confront with any chance of success. The Soldan, however,
after the manner of the baffled in romance, broke the rules of the
tourney and carried off Onoloria by a stratagem.</p>
<p>As his fleet sailed with all speed from Trebizond, it encountered
that of Amadis of Gaul, who was hastening to the relief of that city,
and had evidently not been retarded in his passage of the Dardanelles
by any considerations of international law. In the circumstances it is
scarcely necessary to chronicle the Soldan&rsquo;s overthrow, or dwell
upon his untimely fate.</p>
<p>But the will to evil of the race of Babylon was not extinguished by
the decease of the short-lived if romantically named Zairo. By his
death his sister Abra succeeded to the throne of Semiramis. While
sojourning at Trebizond in the happy days before hostilities had broken
out between her brother and Lisuarte, she had fallen under the spell of
that champion&rsquo;s attractions, and after the manner of Eastern
womanhood as depicted by the writers of romance, made the first
advances to the object of her affections. Let us hope that he did not
repulse her as rudely as did blunt Sir Bevis of Hamton, when the fair
Saracen Josiana sent her envoys to him to acquaint him with her
passion:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He said, if ye ne were messengers,</p>
<p class="line">I should ye slay, ye lossengers. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">I ne will rise one foot fro&rsquo; grounde</p>
<p class="line">For to speak with an heathen hounde.</p>
<p class="line">She is a hound, also be ye:</p>
<p class="line">Out of my chamber swith ye flee.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But repulse her Lisuarte did, and all the fury of a
woman scorned burned in the breast of the fair Babylonian. Out of the
depths of her vengeance she sent emissaries to all the kingdoms of the
earth, asking that the knighthood of every realm should assist her to
destroy Lisuarte. One of her damsels while on this quest met with
Amadis of Greece, who, still a pagan, was easily inveigled into
promising that he would never rest until he had presented the lady Abra
with the head of Lisuarte. On the arrival of Amadis at Trebizond a
dreadful combat between father and son ensued, which was mercifully
broken off by the timely appearance of Urganda, who, following her
usual custom, made parent and child known to one another.</p>
<p>But the young Amadis was not to be exempt from the amorous advances
of pagan princesses any more than his father had been. Niquea, the
daughter of an Eastern soldan, had fallen in love with him by report,
and had sent him her picture by the hands of a favourite dwarf. The
lady&rsquo;s undoubted attractions were, however, seriously
counterbalanced by the circumstance that all who beheld her resplendent
beauty either died on the spot or were deprived of reason. Her father,
in the exercise of ordinary wisdom, shut her up in an almost
inaccessible tower, to which her relatives (who, like most family
friends, were rather apt to discount her charms) alone had the
<i>entr&eacute;e</i>.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the former strong attachment of Amadis to the
Princess of Sicily, he had no sooner set <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>eyes on the portrait
of Niquea than he renounced his former allegiance and devoted his
affections to the Oriental beauty. In order that he might delight his
eyes with the original of the portrait which had so enchanted him, he
disguised himself as a female slave, and gained access to the tower in
which Niquea was interned. They plighted their troth to each other, and
Amadis remained in the tower in his disguise. Needless to say,
Niquea&rsquo;s good looks wrought him no bale.</p>
<p>We now return to the fair but vindictive Abra, who, having
marshalled an immense army, marched against Trebizond. After a furious
encounter, the forces of paynimrie were duly routed. But as Onoloria
had in the meantime been so obliging as to shake off the trammels of
mortality, Lisuarte, at the persuasion of his platonic friend
Gradaffile, agreed to cement a lasting peace by espousing the
Babylonian queen, who was thus lucky in love if unlucky in war.</p>
<p>Niquea, tiring of her virtual imprisonment, succeeded in eloping
with Amadis, and soon afterward arrived with him at Trebizond, where
their nuptials were celebrated. Later she gave birth to a son named
Florisel de Niquea, the subject of a future tale.</p>
<p>This romance, like that of <i>Esplandian</i>, ends with the
enchantment of the Greek heroes and princesses in the Tower of the
Universe by the spells of the wise magician Zirfea, who warned them
that by this means alone could they escape mortality. But, unlike the
enchantment of the Firm Island, the spell which they must needs undergo
in this tower of marvels was not of a somnolent character, so that the
enchanted paladins and their lady-loves were enabled to cultivate each
other&rsquo;s society for a century or so, an advantage at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>which they had small occasion to grumble, when
their long separation as relatives is taken into account. Even did they
tire of one another&rsquo;s society, they were not likely to fall under
the more dreadful spell of boredom, since the accommodating magician
who undertook their enchantment had provided an apparatus by means of
which they could behold every event which took place in the world, a
vehicle of solace and amusement which Madame d&rsquo;Aulnoy introduced
into one of her fairy fictions.</p>
<p>Cervantes&rsquo; barber and priest were especially caustic regarding
<i>Amadis of Greece</i> and its immediate successors. &ldquo;Into the
yard with them all,&rdquo; quoth the priest, &ldquo;for rather than not
burn the queen Pintiquinestra and the shepherd Darinel with his
eclogues and the devilish intricate discourses of its author, I would
burn the father who begot me, did I meet him in the garb of a knight
errant.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">The composition which chiefly seems to have excited
the wrath of Cervantes&rsquo; unromantic churchman and even more
unpoetic barber is the Tenth Book of <i>Amadis</i>, which is entitled
as above, and is feigned to be written by no less a person than Cirfea,
Queen of the Argives, who doubtless composed it in the intervals of
repose stolen from the more important duties of royalty. Her Majesty
does not degrade her exalted position by revealing to us the fee which
she received from the Valladolid publishers who produced the work in
1532, but if one may place a value on her compositions without breaking
the dread law of <i lang="fr">l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i>, it might
be suggested that a penny a line would amply remunerate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>the
literary output of this most imaginative sovereign. In a word, Cirfea,
or the scribbler who sought to shelter himself behind her royal robes,
is tiresome to a degree, and her pastoral absurdities can scarcely be
described otherwise than in a vein of humorous tolerance. The one thing
that renders her work of any importance is that she was probably the
first to import the sylvan element into romance, and is thus the
creator of that long line of artificial and over-amorous shepherds and
shepherdesses whose tears and sighs fall upon or are wafted over the
poetic pages of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the
insistence of whose plaints makes one dread to open a volume which
seems in any way reminiscent of <i lang="fr">l&rsquo;esprit de
berg&egrave;res</i>.</p>
<p>The romance introduces us to Sylvia, the daughter of Lisuarte and
Onoloria, who was, in the course of nature, removed from her parents in
infancy, and was brought up to a pastoral life in the neighbourhood of
Alexandria, which, if it enjoyed a reputation in her day as a
sheep-rearing district, must have owed it to the well-known properties
of sand as a medium for the fattening of those animals for the market.
As Sylvia grew up she became conscious of her beauty, and, relying upon
her good looks, and no doubt also upon her pretty name, she enslaved to
her will the handsome swain Darinel, whose appellation, like that of
his lady-love, is racy of the land of the Pharaohs. Sylvia conceived it
as being correct in a shepherdess to be &lsquo;cruel&rsquo; to her
lover, who, thus setting the fashion for many a future sonneteer,
complained bitterly of her indifference, and signified his intention of
ending his days by exposing himself to the fury of the elements on a
mountain-top&mdash;rather a prolonged operation, one would think, in a
region especially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158"
name="pb158">158</a>]</span>suited to pulmonary patients. Probably
finding that the climate of Egypt scarcely lent itself to the
consummation of such a fate, he betook himself to the region of
Babylonia, where, in the intervals of searching for mountains in a land
where they are tantalizingly absent, he found time to make a friendship
with Florisel, whose good nature must have been sorely tried by his
plaintive apostrophes to his mistress&rsquo;s eyebrow. So glowing,
indeed, were Darinel&rsquo;s descriptions of Sylvia&rsquo;s charms that
Florisel became infected with his unhappy comrade&rsquo;s emotion, so
that at last, unable to combat the passion which was consuming him, he
disguised himself as a shepherd and prevailed upon the luckless Darinel
to conduct him to Sylvia&rsquo;s abode. But although Florisel had paid
her the great compliment of walking all the way from Babylon for a
glance from her bright eyes, she showed herself every whit as cold to
him as she had been to Darinel.</p>
<p>One evening, when Florisel deigns to grant the reader a blessed
intermission from his pleadings to the fair shepherdess, he described
to her how the prince Anastarax, brother of Niquea, had been enclosed
in a fiery palace by the enchantments of the potent magician Zirfea. On
hearing the story, the petulant Sylvia fell headlong in love with
Anastarax, and persuaded Florisel and Darinel, who no longer hankered
after Alpine rigours, to attempt the deliverance of the fire-encircled
prince. But when they arrived in the vicinity of the tower in which he
was detained they learned that the adventure was reserved for
Alastraxare, a fair Amazon, daughter of Amadis of Greece and the Queen
of Caucasus. The reader is now compelled to follow the fortunes of this
female Hercules, whose tongue-encircling name has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>proved a stumbling-block to generations of
printers. These are spread over many pages. The little party from
Alexandria went in search of this heroine, and encountered many
adventures, as per arrangement with the booksellers. Chief among these
was the amorous dalliance with Arlanda, princess of Thrace, who had
fallen in love with Florisel by report, as ladies had a disconcerting
habit of doing in the days of high romance. She donned the clothes of
the immaculate Sylvia, and thus beguiled him to a moonlight rendezvous,
where she succeeded in gaining his favour while he was under the
impression that she was the shepherdess whom he had vainly pursued so
long.</p>
<p>In the course of their wanderings Sylvia became separated from the
rest of the party during a great storm, and, retracing her steps, made
her way back to the flaming prison of Anastarax. Meanwhile Florisel and
Darinel arrived on the coast of Apollonia, where the former happily
forgot the charms of the capricious little shepherdess, who by this
time had been duly discovered as the daughter of Lisuarte, and had been
united to her beloved Anastarax. But it was not because he suffered
from a failing memory that Florisel became oblivious of Sylvia, but
rather on account of the bright eyes of the Princess Helena of
Apollonia.</p>
<p>The sequence of the tale is now broken up in a manner calculated to
aggravate the most hardened of readers. Florisel was not left much
leisure to enjoy the society of the fascinating Apollonian princess, as
the deliverance of his kindred from the enchanted tower had all along
been reserved for him. When at last he had satisfied the promptings of
duty, he set his face once more toward Apollonia, but was not, of
course, destined to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>arrive on the shores of that delectable
kingdom without undergoing still further adventures. Landing at
Colchos, he met with Alastraxare, who had found happiness with
Falanges, a brilliant warrior of Florisel&rsquo;s train. Arriving at
last in Apollonia, he found the Princess Helena on the eve of a
marriage with the Prince of Gaul, a match ordained by the lady&rsquo;s
politic father. But Florisel would have belied the adventurous blood
which he drew from a long line of heroes who had never yet remained
inactive in such a contingency if he had failed to defeat the
tyrannical father&rsquo;s intentions, so, as our royal authoress
remarks, he repeated the exploit of Paris in the tale of Troy by
carrying off this second Helen.</p>
<p>Like its prototype of Homeric story, this action very naturally
precipitated the kingdoms of the East and West, real and apocryphal,
into a condition of chaotic warfare. Assisted by the Russians, who even
at that distant epoch appear to have had a predilection for the task of
social demolition, the countries of the West poured their myriads upon
the plains of Constantinople, and inflicted a serious reverse upon the
Hellenic arms. But the erratic Slavs, true to type, turned later upon
their allies of the Occident, drove them from the shores of the Golden
Horn, and finally secured Florisel in the possession of the capital of
the East and the Princess Helena.</p>
<p>Here the august Cirfea might with all judiciousness have written
&ldquo;Finis&rdquo; with her golden pen to this amazing history. But at
this stage of events, if a phrase so familiarly colloquial may be
employed regarding one so exalted, she &lsquo;gets her second
wind,&rsquo; probably in view of the circumstance that her bargain with
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>booksellers of Valladolid stipulated that their
patrons were to be regaled with so many thousand lines of her glowing
periods, an arrangement in which she was probably loath to disappoint
them, for reasons to which, as a crowned head, she should have been
superior. But her domain of Argolis is proverbially a poor country,
whose populace possesses a rooted and hereditary bias against taxation.
Be that as it may, she was not the last Balkan sovereign to supply
herself with pin-money by literary labours. Equipping herself,
therefore, with a fresh ream of parchment from the Department of
Archives (for Government paper has proverbially been everybody&rsquo;s
property, even from the times of Khammurabi), she cast about for fresh
situations and addressed herself to the task of &lsquo;spinning
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the treacherous Russians had accounted for the armies of the
West, they embarked for their own country, there to hatch fresh schemes
for the further disturbance of a harassed Europe. But Amadis of Greece
was in no mind that a people who owed so many debts to civilization (to
say nothing of vast pecuniary obligations) should escape unpunished for
their original adherence to the enemy. Pursuing them, but losing track
of their vessels, he came to the inevitable desert island, where he
resolved to stay and do penance for his infidelity to the Princess of
Sicily. Quite naturally, that lady herself landed on its shores, and,
after upbraiding her unfaithful lover, very sensibly advised him to
return to his sorrowing wife Niquea, which he at last consented to
do.</p>
<p>When, after a reasonable interval, Amadis did not return to
Constantinople, the imperial city was in an uproar, and Florisel and
Falanges elected to go in quest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>of him. They arrived in time
at the island, where, under the assumed name of Moraizel, the former
fell in love with and espoused its queen, Sidonia, who, however, did
not scruple to show her preference for his companion. But Florisel soon
tired of his island bride, who bore him a beautiful little daughter,
Diana, destined to prove the heroine of the eleventh and twelfth books
of this interminable history.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3492" class="main">Agesilan of Colchos</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The young Agesilan of Colchos was prosecuting his
studies at Athens when he chanced to see a statue of the beauteous
Diana. Irresistibly attracted by it, he resolved to search for and
behold the original, so, donning the garb of a female minstrel, he
fared to the Court of Queen Sidonia, the royal maiden&rsquo;s mother.
Here he was employed as a companion to the princess. But when a
succession of adventurous knights arrived in the island he could not
refrain from giving them battle in the guise of an Amazon, with results
invariably in his favour.</p>
<p>Learning from the Queen how she had been neglected by Florisel,
Agesilan obligingly offered to bring her the head of the erring
warrior, revealing, at the same time, his own personality. Sidonia, who
bore her husband a deep grudge for his desertion of her, readily
accepted his championship. So Agesilan repaired to Constantinople and
defied the recreant to mortal combat. It was arranged that the
encounter should take place in the dominions of Sidonia, but on the
would-be combatants arriving in these regions they found them
beleaguered by the ubiquitous Russians, who, not content with the
freedom of their own vast steppes, seem to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>have
hankered after a place in the sun in a more genial clime. It was
scarcely fair to the ebullient Slavs to launch two such renowned
paladins upon them at one and the same time, but, the brief battle
over, victory seems to have made Florisel and Sidonia forget their
estrangement, and all went merry as a marriage bell, Agesilan being
duly affianced to Diana.</p>
<p>It was agreed, however, that the splendours of Constantinople would
provide a more fitting background to their nuptials, and accordingly
all set sail for the Golden Horn, having first been honoured by a visit
from Amadis of Gaul in person, who, notwithstanding his patriarchal
years, still continued to prove the delights of errantry. He was
accompanied by Amadis of Greece, who, though almost as venerable as his
great-grandfather, could yet break a lance with any like-minded
champion.</p>
<p>They had not proceeded far from the shores of the island when they
were beset by a furious tempest, in which Agesilan and Diana were
separated from the rest of their kindred and cast upon a desert rock,
where they would have perished had not an accommodating knight, mounted
upon a hippogriff, who chanced to be flying overhead, picked them up
and carried them to his home in the Canary Islands. But their
preserver&rsquo;s disinterestedness vanished on beholding the beauty of
Diana, so, when Agesilan was off his guard, he bore her to a distant
part of the Green Island, as his demesne was called. His amorous dream
was, however, destined to be rudely broken in upon, for at that moment
a party of corsairs landed, and seeing in Diana a prize who would bring
them a large sum in the nearest slave-market, promptly bore her
off.</p>
<p>Agesilan, on being unable to find Diana, suspected <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>treachery, so mounted the hippogriff and set out
in search of her. Having in vain surveyed the island from the back of
the winged monster, in his despair he took to flying at large. Whether
from &lsquo;engine trouble&rsquo; or causes even more obscure, he was
forced to alight in the country of the Garamantes, the king of which
had been struck blind as a punishment for his overweening pride.
Moreover, the unfortunate monarch was doomed to have the food prepared
for him devoured daily by a hideous dragon. From this monster Agesilan
delivered him. The whole incident is an unblushing imitation of a
passage in <i>Orlando Furioso</i> (can. xxxiii, st. 102 ff.), in which
Senapus, King of Ethiopia, is visited by a like misfortune, and has his
food daily destroyed by harpies until relieved by Astolpho, who
descends in his dominions on a winged steed. But the author of
<i>Agesilan</i> is no whit more guilty than Ariosto himself, for both
incidents are derived originally from the story of Phineus and the
harpies in the <i>Argonautica</i> of Apollonius Rhodius.</p>
<p>Agesilan, pursuing the quest of Diana, arrived at the Desolate Isle.
The god Tervagant (Termagaunt, Tyr Magus=&rsquo;Tyr the Mighty&rsquo;)
had fallen in love with the queen of this country, and on being
repulsed by her let loose a band of demons upon her possessions, who
ravaged them far and wide. The god&rsquo;s oracle had announced that he
would not be appeased unless the inhabitants daily exposed a maiden on
the sea-shore until such time as he found one as much to his taste as
the Queen. Each day a hapless damsel was chained to a rock on the
desolate shores of the island, and was promptly devoured by a monster
which rose out of the sea. This naturally rendered the supply of
maidens <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>in the vicinity rather scarce, so in order to
save one of the local ladies for another occasion, Diana, who had been
brought to the island, was tied to the rock one morning and, like
another Andromeda, of whose myth the incident is a paraphrase, was left
to the mercy of the monster. Agesilan, soaring through the air on his
hippogriff, witnessed her plight, descended to her aid, and, after a
terrific combat, slew the monster which had been about to devour
her.</p>
<p>Having accounted for the grisly satellite of Tervagant, he placed
the almost unconscious Diana upon his aery steed, whose head he turned
in the direction of Constantinople; but on the way thither this now
practised airman caught sight of the ship of Amadis from which he and
his mistress had been separated in the tempest. Alighting on the vessel
with all the skill of a sea-plane pilot on the deck of a
&lsquo;mother-ship,&rsquo; he greeted his astonished kindred, and the
party eventually reached Constantinople, where the wedding of the
principal characters was solemnized.</p>

we shall forbear to describe, only remarking <i>en passant</i> that, in
the mercantile phrase, its details are &lsquo;up to sample.&rsquo; But
if the Greek princes bethought them to escape the consequences of
having incurred the enmity of the turbulent Russ merely by defeating
him in the field, they were destined to receive a rude awakening, for
by one fell stroke of necromantic art the entire galaxy was spirited
away. Once more the inhabitants of the romantic city on the Bosphorus
were plunged into the deepest consternation; but, nothing daunted at
the task which now confronted them, the knights and paladins of the
family&mdash;in themselves an army of no mean dimensions&mdash;set out
in search of their honoured relatives. But we are not yet liberated
from the tangle of plot and counter-plot excogitated by the expiring
hackery of Castile, and the dying candle of the great romance of
<i>Amadis</i> does not flare up and flicker out with the rescue of the
heroes and heroines who have swaggered through its pages in almost
immortal sequel of intrigue and battle. For, the princesses having been
brought safely back to Constantinople, it was discovered that during
their absence some of them had been blessed with little olive branches,
many of whose adventures are related, until the bewildered reader, lost
in the maze of their story, like Milton&rsquo;s Satan, looks round in
desperation for any outlet of escape, exclaiming with the fallen great
one:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Me miserable, which way shall I fly?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But, like the doomed archangel, he must &lsquo;dree
his weird,&rsquo; and wade through the adventures of Spheramond, son of
Rogel of Greece, and Amadis of Astre, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>son of
Agesilan&mdash;or, better still, he may do as we did, and, reverently
closing the worm-eaten volume, restore it to the library, where its
embossed back is, perhaps, rather more appreciated than its grotesque
contents.</p>
<p>Instead of being hurled from the throne by an incensed and neglected
populace, the line of Amadis continued to flourish exceedingly, and
perhaps the secret of its success as a dynasty lies in the fact that it
was more habitually resident in fire-ringed castles or enchanted
islands than in its palace in the metropolis, which it seems to have
chiefly employed as a convalescent establishment in which to recover
from wounds delivered by magic swords and the poisonous bites of
&lsquo;loathly&rsquo; dragons, rather than as a seat of governmental
activity and imperial direction.</p>
<p>We have seen how the great theme of <i>Amadis of Gaul</i> burst upon
Spain in a blaze of glory, and how, mangled by the efforts of fluent
hacks, it sank into insignificance amid the derision of the enlightened
and the gibes of the vulgar. It is as if our own peerless British epos
of Arthur, that thrice heroic treasury of the deeds of those who</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Jousted in Aspremont or Montalban,</p>
<p class="line">Damasco, or Morocco, or Trebizond,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">had been seized upon by Grub Street and prostituted to
the necessities of scribblers. We cannot give thanks enough to the god
of letters that it has escaped such a doom, though this has been more
by virtue of good hap than through that of any protecting influence.
The sequels of <i>Amadis</i> descend by stages of lessening excellence
until at length they approach the limits of drivel. But does this
sorrowful circumstance in any way dim the glory of the first fine
rapture? Nay, no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"
name="pb168">168</a>]</span>more than darkness can cloud the memory of
morning. The knightly eloquence of the original characters may
degenerate in rodomontade; the lofty and delicate imagery of the
primary books may merge into unspeakable vulgarities of invention; the
tender beauty which enchants the first love idyll may become coarse
intrigue. But no work of art is to be judged by its imitations. With
the exception of the Fifth Book, the remaining <i>Amadis</i> romances
are as oleographs placed beside a noble painting. Unrestrained in
execution, daubed in colours of the harshest crudity, uneven in outline
and distressing in <i>ensemble</i>, they are more fitted for the
scullions&rsquo; hall than the picture-gallery. Yet they may not be
passed over in a work dealing with Spanish romance, and they point a
moral which in this twentieth century it is fitting that we should
digest&mdash;that if a nation acquiesce in the debasement of its
literary standards and revel in the worthless and the excitement of
meretricious fiction, it will cease to excel among the comity of
peoples. Literature is the expression of a nation&rsquo;s soul. And
what species of soul is that which voices itself in crudely jacketed
novelettes, redolent of a psychology at once ridiculous and unhealthy?
Have we no Cervantes to shatter this ignoble thing to the sound of
inextinguishable laughter? Is not the sad lesson of <i>Amadis</i> one
for the consideration of our own people? Spain was never so great as
when its first books roused her chivalry to an ardour of knightly
patriotism, and she was never so little as when the printing-presses of
Burgos and Valladolid and Saragossa flooded her cities with a mercenary
and undistinguished fiction, prompted by commercial greed, and joyfully
received by a public avid for the drug of sensation. <span class=

<div class="epigraph">
<p class="first">Let Palmerin of England be preserved as a singular
relic of antiquity.</p>
<p class="xd19e562"><span class="sc">Cervantes</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It would seem to have been a foible with the early
critics of Spanish romance to seek to discover a Portuguese origin for
practically all of its manifestations. They appear to have argued from
the analogy of <i>Amadis</i> that all romantic effort hailed from the
Lusitanian kingdom, yet they are never weary of descanting upon the
Proven&ccedil;al and Moorish influences which moulded Spanish romance!
It is precisely as if one said: &ldquo;Yes, the Arthurian story
displays every sign of Norman-French influence, but all the same, it
was first cast into literary form in Wales. England? Oh, England merely
accepted it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Palmerin</i> series ran almost side by side with
<i>Amadis</i> in a chronological sense, and tradition ascribed its
first book to an anonymous lady of Augustobriga. But there is reason to
believe, from a passage in <i>Primale&oacute;n</i>, one of its
sections, that it was the work of Francisco Vasquez de Ciudad Rodrigo.
No early Portuguese version is known, and the Spanish edition of the
first romance of the series, <i>Palmerin de Oliva</i>, printed at
Seville in 1525, was certainly not the earliest impression of that
work. The English translation, by Anthony Munday, was published in
black letter in 1588.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e3608" class="main">Palmerin de Oliva</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No sooner did <i>Palmerin de Oliva</i> appear than it
scored a success only second to that of <i>Amadis</i>, its resemblance
to which can scarcely be called fortuitous, and, as in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>case
of that romance, translations and continuations were multiplied with
surprising rapidity.</p>
<p>The commencement of <i>Palmerin de Oliva</i> carries us once more to
the enchanted shores of the Golden Horn. Reymicio, the Emperor of
Constantinople, had a daughter named Griana, whom he had resolved to
give in marriage to Tarisius, son of the King of Hungary, and nephew to
the Empress. But Griana had given her heart to Florendos of Macedon, to
whom she had a son. Dreading the wrath of her father, she permitted an
attendant to carry the infant to a deserted spot, where it was found by
a peasant, who took it to his cottage, and brought it up as his own
son, calling the child Palmerin de Oliva, because he had been found on
a hill which was covered with a luxuriant growth of palm and olive
trees.</p>
<p>When the boy grew up he accepted his humble lot with equanimity. But
on learning that he was not the son of a peasant he longed for a life
of martial excitement. Adventure soon afforded him a taste of its
dazzling possibilities. While traversing a gloomy forest in search of
game he encountered a merchant beset by a ferocious lion. He slew the
beast, and learned that the traveller was returning to his own country
from Constantinople. Attaching himself to the man of commerce, Palmerin
accompanied him to the city of Hermide, where his grateful companion
furnished him with arms and a horse. Thus accoutred for the life
chivalric, he betook himself to the Court of Macedon, where he received
the honour of knighthood from Florendes, the son of the king of that
country, and his own father.</p>
<p>A quest soon presented itself to him. Primale&oacute;n, King of
Macedon, had long been a sufferer from a grievous sickness. His
physicians assured him that could he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>obtain water from a
certain fountain his malady would disappear. But the spring in question
was guarded by an immense serpent of such ferocity that to approach its
lair meant certain death. Knight after knight had essayed the
adventure, only to be crushed in the monster&rsquo;s venomous folds, so
that the life-giving waters the ailing King so sorely required
continued to be withheld from him. This condition of affairs seemed to
Palmerin to present him with an opportunity for distinguishing himself,
and without realizing the strenuous nature of the task before him he
leapt into the saddle and cantered off in the direction of the
serpent-guarded fountain.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3632" class="main">The Fairy Damsels</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Very conscious of the honour of knighthood which but
so lately had been conferred upon him, and inordinately proud of the
gilded spurs which glittered on his mailed heels, Palmerin was not a
little pleased that he had succeeded in attracting the attention of a
bevy of young and beautiful ladies, who stood where field and forest
met, watching his rather haughty progress with laughing eyes. Had he
been less occupied with himself and his horse, which he forced to
curvet and caracole in the most outrageous fashion, he would have seen
that the damsels before whom he wished to cut such a fine figure were
of a beauty far too ethereal to be human, for the ladies who watched
him with such amusement were princesses of the race of Faery, and had
waylaid the young knight with the intention of giving him such aid as
fairies have in their power.</p>
<p>Palmerin greeted them with all the distinction of which he was
capable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=

<p>&ldquo;God save you, fair damsels,&rdquo; he said, bowing almost to
his horse&rsquo;s mane. &ldquo;Can you tell me if I am near the
serpent-guarded fountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair sir,&rdquo; replied one of the sylphs, &ldquo;you are
within a league of it. But let us entreat you to turn back from such a
neighbourhood as this. Many famous knights have we seen pass this way
to do battle with the monster who guards its waters, but none have we
seen return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my custom to turn my back upon an
enterprise,&rdquo; said Palmerin loftily. &ldquo;Did I understand you
to say the fountain lies within a league of this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a short league, Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied the fairy.
Then, turning to her companions, she said: &ldquo;Sisters, this would
seem to be the youth we have awaited so long. He appears bold and
resolute. Shall we confer upon him the gift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her companions having given their assent to this proposal, the fairy
then enlightened Palmerin regarding the true character of herself and
her attendant maidens, and assured him that wherever he went, or
whatever adventure he undertook, neither monster nor magician would
have the power to cast enchantment upon him. Then, directing him more
particularly to the lair of the serpent, they disappeared in the
recesses of the forest.</p>
<p>Riding on, he speedily came within view of the fountain, but had
scarcely beheld its silver waters bubbling from a green hill-side when
a horrible hissing warned him of the proximity of its loathly guardian.
All unafraid, however, he spurred his terrified horse forward. A blast
of fire, belched from the monster&rsquo;s mouth, surged over him, but
he bent low in the saddle and avoided it. Then, dashing at the
bristling head, poised on a neck thick as a pillar, and armoured with
dazzling scales, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173"
name="pb173">173</a>]</span>struck fiercely at it with his falchion.
The serpent tried to envelop horse and man in its folds, but ere it
could bring its grisly coils to bear upon them Palmerin had smitten off
its head.</p>
<p>Returning to Macedon, the young hero was at once overwhelmed by the
applications of importunate monarchs that he should assist them in one
enterprise or another. All of these Palmerin achieved with such
consummate address that his fame spread into all parts of Europe, and
we find him as far afield as Belgium, where he delivered the Emperor of
Germany from certain traitor knights who besieged him in the town of
Ghent. It was during this adventure that he met and became enamoured of
the Emperor&rsquo;s daughter, the beauteous Polinarda, who had on one
occasion appeared to him in a dream. But the young paladin felt that if
he were to render himself worthy of such a peerless lady he must subdue
many knights in her name, and undertake adventures even more onerous
than those through which he had already come scathless. Learning,
therefore, of a great tournament in the land of France, he journeyed
thither, and bore off the prize.</p>
<p>Returning to Germany, Palmerin found the Emperor engaged in a war
with the King of England, at the instance of the King of Norway, who
had requested his assistance against the British monarch. This
partisanship did not, however, appeal to Trineus, the Emperor&rsquo;s
son, who, enamoured of the princess Agriola, daughter of the English
king, privately departed with Palmerin, his object being to aid the
father of his lady-love. After undergoing many adventures, the
companions succeeded in carrying off the English princess, but while
voyaging homeward were attacked by a furious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>tempest and were driven on the shores of the
Morea. When the elements subsided Palmerin landed on the neighbouring
island of Calpa, to engage in the sport of hawking, and during his
absence the vessel in which he had left his friends was seized by
Turkish pirates, who carried Agriola as a present to the Grand Turk.
Trineus was even less happily situated, for being marooned upon an
island, which we must surely regard as that of Circe, he was
immediately transformed into a dog. To add to this indignity, his
transformation did not take the shape of any of the more noble
varieties of the canine race, but that of a tiny lap-dog, such as are
found in ladies&rsquo; boudoirs.</p>
<p>In the meantime Palmerin, all unconscious of the fate of his
friends, was discovered in the island of Calpa by Archidiana, daughter
of the Soldan of Babylon, who at once pressed him into her service,
refusing to allow him to depart. Archidiana had from the first
conceived a violent passion for the handsome young adventurer, whose
embarrassment was heightened by the knowledge that her cousin,
Ardemira, had likewise fallen in love with him. The knight, however,
stoutly repelled the fair advances, and Ardemira took her repulse so
much to heart that she burst a blood-vessel and expired, shortly after
the party had arrived at the Babylonian Court. Hearing of her demise,
Amaran, son of the King of Phrygia, to whom she had been affianced,
hastened to Babylon, and precipitately accused Archidiana of her death,
offering to make good his assertion by an appeal to arms. Palmerin, as
in duty bound, espoused the princess&rsquo;s quarrel, slew Amaran in
single combat, and by doing so won the good graces of the Soldan, whom
he assisted in the war with Phrygia which followed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Soldan, elated by his military successes, resolved to extend his
empire, and with this object in view fitted out a great expedition
against Constantinople, which Palmerin was forced to accompany. But
during a tempest which the Babylonian fleet encountered he commanded
the seamen of his own vessel to steer for the German coast. On reaching
it he made his way to the capital, and made himself known in secret to
Polinarda, with whom he spent some time.</p>
<p>But his heart misgave him regarding the fate of his friend Trineus,
and he resolved to set out in quest of that unhappy prince. Journeying
across Europe, he arrived at the city of Buda, where he learned that
Florendos, Prince of Macedon, had recently slain Tarisius, who, it will
be remembered, was his rival for the hand of the Princess Griana, and
whom she had been forced to marry by her tyrannous father, the Emperor
of Constantinople. Florendos had, however, been taken captive by the
kinsmen of Tarisius, and had been sent to Constantinople, where he was
condemned to be burnt at the stake, along with Griana, who was believed
to be his accomplice. On hearing of the impending fate of those who,
unknown to him, were his parents, Palmerin at once repaired to
Constantinople, where he maintained their innocence, defeated their
accusers, the nephews of Tarisius, in a combat <i>&agrave;
outrance</i>, and succeeded in saving them from the terrible fate which
had awaited them. While he lay in bed recovering from his wounds he was
visited by the grateful Griana, who, from a mark upon his face and the
account of his exposure as an infant, knew that he must be her son. On
hearing her story the Emperor joyfully received Palmerin and
acknowledged him as his successor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176"

<h3 id="xd19e3677" class="main">The Quest for Trineus</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But his new accession to power did not render Palmerin
unmindful of his vow to search for his lost friend Trineus. Sailing
over the Mediterranean in quest of him, he fell in with an overwhelming
force of Turks, and was taken prisoner. Brought to the palace of the
Grand Turk, he succeeded in liberating the princess Agriola from the
power of that tyrant. Effecting his own escape, he came to the palace
of a princess to whom Trineus in his shape of a lap-dog had been
presented by those who had found him. This lady had contracted a severe
inflammation in the nose (unromantic detail!), and requested Palmerin
to accompany her to Mussabelin, a Persian magician, whom she believed
to be able to remove the distressing complaint. But the sage informed
her that only by means of the flowers of a tree which grew near the
Castle of the Ten Steps could she be cured.</p>
<p>Now the castle of which the magician spoke was guarded by
enchantment. But that dread power was harmless to Palmerin, ever since
the fairy sisters had provided him with an antidote against it. Making
his way to the magic castle, he secured the flowers of the healing
tree, and also took captive an enchanted bird, which was destined to
announce the hour of his death by an unearthly shriek. He further ended
the enchantments of the castle, and when they finally dissolved,
Trineus, who had accompanied him in canine shape, was restored to his
original form.</p>
<p>The subsequent adventures of Palmerin bear such a strong likeness to
those already related of him as to render their recital a work of
supererogation. From <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span>the Court of one soldan he proceeds to that
of another, enchantment follows enchantment, as combat treads upon the
heels of combat. Finally Palmerin and Trineus return to Europe, and wed
their respective ladies.</p>
<p>Cervantes&rsquo; curate is perhaps too hard upon <i>Palmerin de

curate; &lsquo;here, take this <i>Oliva</i>; let it be hewn in pieces
and burnt, and the ashes scattered in the air.&rsquo;&rdquo; This
notwithstanding, there are some brilliant passages in the romance we
have just outlined&mdash;grains of golddust in a desert of unrestrained
and undisciplined narrative&mdash;such flashes of genius as we find
here and there in Shelley&rsquo;s <i>Zastrozzi</i>, <i>St Irvyne</i>,
and the other hysterical outpourings of his Oxford days.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no doubt regarding the thoroughly Spanish
character and origin of <i>Primale&oacute;n</i>, son and successor to
<i>Palmerin de Oliva</i>, although, owing to the prejudice of the time
for mystery and Orientalism, its author, Francisco Delicado, saw fit to
announce it as a translation from the Greek. The first edition was
printed in 1516, and several translations shortly followed, that in
English, by Anthony Munday, being dedicated to Sir Francis Drake, and
published in 1589. This translation, however, dealt only with that
portion of the romance which related to the exploits of Polendos, but
Munday completed the whole in editions published in 1595 and 1619. The
adventures of Polendos constitute, however, by far the best part of the
work.</p>
<p>Polendos was the son of the Queen of Tharsus. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>Returning one day from the chase, he beheld a
little old woman sitting on the steps of the palace, from which he
removed her by a most ungallant but forceful kick. &ldquo;It was not in
this manner that your father Palmerin succoured the unfortunate,&rdquo;
cried the crone, on picking herself up. Polendos thus learned the
secret of his birth, for he was indeed the son of Palmerin and the
Queen of Tharsus, and, exalted by the intelligence, he burned to
distinguish himself by feats of arms worthy of his sire. Departing for
Constantinople to make himself known to his father, he encountered many
adventures on the way. Arrived at the imperial city, he did not long
remain there, but set out to rescue the Princess Francelina from the
power of a giant and a dwarf, who held her in bondage in an enchanted
castle. Returning to Constantinople, he greatly distinguished himself
at a tournament held on the occasion of the marriage of one of the
Emperor&rsquo;s daughters, and Primale&oacute;n, the real hero of the
story, son of Palmerin and Polinarda, desirous of emulating the
exploits of his half-brother, was duly knighted, and took part in the
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>. The rest of the romance is occupied with the
adventures of this young hero and those of Duardos (Edward) of England.
In the course of his adventures Palmerin had slain the son of the
Duchess of Armedos, who vowed that she would only give her daughter in
marriage to the man who could bring her the head of Primale&oacute;n.
One by one Primale&oacute;n slew the lovers of Gridoina, the
Duchess&rsquo;s daughter, so that in time she came to detest the mere
mention of his name. But one evening Primale&oacute;n arrived at her
castle, and, not knowing who he was, she fell deeply in love with him.
The child of their affections was Platir, whose exploits were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>recounted by the same author, and published at
Valladolid in 1533. We may well pass over this very indifferent
romance, and bestow our attention and interest upon its more
entertaining successor.</p>

<p class="first">This is perhaps the best of the series. The first
Spanish edition was believed to be lost; but a French translation from
it was published at Lyons in 1553, and an Italian one at Venice in
1555. Southey maintained that there never was a Spanish original of
this story, and that it was first written in Portuguese. But this
hypothesis was upset by Salva&rsquo;s discovery of a copy of the lost
Spanish original, written by Luis Kuxtado<a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e3729src" href="#xd19e3729" name="xd19e3729src">1</a> and
published at Toledo in two parts, in 1547 and 1548. Southey attempted
to show in his English translation of <i>Palmerin of England</i> that a
consideration of its <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> would afford
irrefragable proof of its Lusitanian origin&mdash;surely a good
illustration of the dangers and fallacies connected with this species
of reasoning. An argument of equal cogency could be advanced for its
original English authorship, as most of its action takes place within
the borders of the &lsquo;perilous isle&rsquo; of Britain, in which
respect it follows <i>Amadis</i>, its model.</p>
<p>In <i>Palmerin of England</i> we are provided with a biographical
sketch of the hero&rsquo;s parents. Don Duardos, or Edward, son of the
King of England, was wedded to Flerida, daughter of Palmerin de Oliva.
While engaged in the chase, he lost his way in the depths of an English
forest, and sought shelter in a mysterious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>castle, where he was detained by a giantess,
Eutropa, whose brother he had slain. But Dramuziando, her nephew, son
of the giant whom Duardos had sent to his death, was of milder mood
than his terrible aunt, and conceived a strange friendship for the
captive Duardos.</p>
<p>In the meantime Flerida, alarmed at Duardos&rsquo; absence, set out
to search for him, accompanied by a train of attendants, and while
traversing the forest in the hope of tracing him gave birth to twin
sons, who were baptized in the greenwood by her chaplain. The ceremony
had scarcely come to an end when a wild man, an inhabitant of the
forest recesses, burst from the undergrowth, and, seizing upon the
infant princes, carried them off. None might stay him, for he was
accompanied by two lions of such size and ferocity that their
appearance struck terror into the hearts of the stoutest of
Flerida&rsquo;s retainers.</p>
<p>The savage conveyed the infants, who had been named Palmerin and
Florian, to his den, where he resolved to give them to the lions.
Flerida returned disconsolately to the palace, and dispatched a
messenger to Constantinople with news of her losses. On receiving this
intelligence, Primale&oacute;n and a number of the Grecian knights took
ship for England, and, learning of the imprisonment of Duardos in the
castle of the giantess, they essayed his deliverance. But they made the
mistake, common to errantry, of attempting to do so singly and not in a
body, and so, one by one, fell a rather easy prey to the giant
Dramuziando, who forced them to combat each new enemy who
approached.</p>
<p>The sylvan savage who had destined the royal twins as food for his
lions had reckoned without his wife, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>whose motherly
instincts prompted her to save the children from a fate so dire. Having
prevailed upon her uncouth mate to spare them, she brought them up
along with her own son Selvian. In course of time they became expert in
the chase and woodcraft, and on one of his excursions in the forest
while following the slot of a red deer Florian encountered Sir Pridos,
son of the Duke of Wales, who took him to the English Court, where he
was brought before his mother, Flerida. Attracted to the savage youth,
she adopted him, and trained him in the usages of civilization, calling
him &lsquo;the Child of the Desert.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Florian had not long been lost to the sylvan family when Palmerin
and Selvian, wandering one day by the sea-coast, observed a galley cast
upon the shore by the violence of a tempest. From this vessel Polendos
(whose prior adventures were recited in the romance of
<i>Primale&oacute;n</i>) disembarked, having come to England with other
Greek knights in search of Duardos. Palmerin and Selvian requested him
to take them on board his vessel, which put to sea once more, and
shortly afterward arrived at Constantinople, where they were brought
before the Emperor, who, of course, was in ignorance of the extraction
of Palmerin, but knew of his high rank from letters he had received
from a certain Lady of the Bath, who seems to have acted as the
hero&rsquo;s good genius. The Emperor, impressed by such an
introduction, knighted Palmerin, whose sword was girded to his side by
Polinarda, the daughter of Primale&oacute;n. During Palmerin&rsquo;s
residence at Constantinople a tournament was held, in which he and a
stranger knight, who bore for his device a savage leading two lions,
greatly distinguished themselves. The stranger <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>departed still <i>incognito</i>, but was
afterward discovered to be Florian, who was thenceforth known as
&lsquo;the Knight of the Savage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Palmerin fell an easy victim to the charms of the princess
Polinarda, but the precipitate nature of his wooing, prompted,
probably, by his sylvan upbringing, offended the courtly damsel, and
she forbade him her presence. In despair at her coldness, he quitted
the Grecian capital, and journeyed toward England, under the name of
&lsquo;the Knight of Fortune,&rsquo; taking Selvian as his squire. On
the way he encountered a wealth of adventure, in which he was uniformly
successful, and at last arrived in the dominions of his grandfather.
But while passing through the forest inhabited by his savage
foster-father he came face to face with him, and recounted his
adventures. Pressing on, he came to a castle in the neighbourhood of
London, the castellan of which begged of him to do battle with the
Knight of the Savage, who had slain his son. Arriving in London, he
defied Florian, but the Princess Flerida intervened and forbade the
combat, which was not resumed, for Palmerin having at last overcome
Dramuziando and set Duardos at liberty, the birth of the twin brothers
was revealed by Doliarte, a magician, and confirmed by their savage
foster-father.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Spurred on by the love of adventure, Florian and
Palmerin disdained to lead a life of ease at Court, and set out on
their travels. We cannot follow them here through the maze of exploit
into which they are plunged, but many of their trials, especially those
undergone by Palmerin in the Perilous Isle, are among the most
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>interesting and attractive in the series which
bears his name. In several of the passages the amiable giant
Dramuziando figures to advantage, but his aunt, the vindictive Eutropa,
still retains her ill-will to the family of the Palmerins, and is
constant in the exercise of her machinations against them. These are,
however, challenged and countered by the skill of the magician
Doliarte. The chief scene of adventure is the castle of Almaurol,
where, under the care of a giant, dwelt the beautiful but haughty
Miraguarda, whose lineaments were pictured on a shield which was
suspended over the gate of the castle. It was guarded by a body of
knights, who had become enamoured of the original, and when other
paladins arrived vaunting the charms of their ladies these gave them
battle. Among these victims of the fair Miraguarda was the giant
Dramuziando, but during his custody of the picture it was purloined by
Alhayzar, the Soldan of Babylon, whose lady, Targiana, daughter of the
Grand Turk, had commanded him to bring it to her as a trophy of his
prowess.</p>
<p>The writer of the romance appeared to think it necessary at this
point to recall his heroes to Constantinople in order to espouse them
to their respective ladies. Palmerin was united to Polinarda, and his
brother Florian to Leonarda, Queen of Thrace, so that the lovers were
made happy. These espousals, however, by no means bring the romance to
a conclusion, for we learn that matters had become complicated by the
passion of the daughter of the Grand Turk for the newly wedded Florian.
That gay young prince, while residing at the Court of the lady&rsquo;s
father, had taken the liberty of eloping with her, and although she was
now safely married to Alhayzar, Soldan of Babylon and picture-thief,
she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>still retained a strong affection for her former
lover, which was mingled with resentment that he should have deserted
her charms for those of the Queen of Thrace. To ease the clamours of
her jealous heart, she employed a magician to work woe upon the
Thracian queen, who, while she took the air in the gardens of her
palace, was pounced upon by two enormous griffins, and conveyed to a
magic castle, where she was transformed into a huge serpent. Her
disconsolate husband found in her deliverance an adventure quite to his
taste, and, having consulted the wise Doliarte, succeeded in
discovering the place where his wife was imprisoned and in freeing her
from the enchantment which had been laid upon her.</p>
<p>In accomplishing this, however, he seriously offended the proud
Alhayzar, who determined to avenge the affront placed upon his queen,
and demanded the person of Florian from the Emperor of Constantinople.
On receiving the imperial refusal which naturally followed his request,
he invaded the Greek territories, with an army of two hundred thousand
men, recruited from all the kingdoms and satrapies of the Orient, real
and imaginary. Three sanguinary battles occurred, in one of which
Alhayzar was slain and the pagan army totally annihilated.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3788" class="main">Cervantes&rsquo; Eulogy</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cervantes launches into an extravagant eulogy of this
romance. &ldquo;This <i>Palmerin of England</i>,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;let it be kept and preserved as a thing unique, and let another
casket be made for it such as Alexander found among the spoils of
Darius.... This book, Sir Comrade, is of authority, for two reasons:
the one because it is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>right good one in itself, and the
other because the report is that a wise king of Portugal composed it.
All the adventures at the Castle of Miraguarda are excellent, and
managed with great skill; the discourses are courtly and clear,
observing with much propriety and judgment the decorum of the speaker.
I say then, saving your good pleasure, Master Nicholas, this and
<i>Amadis de Gaul</i> should be saved from the fire, and all the rest
be, without further search, destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saving <i>your</i> good pleasure, Master Cervantes, I would come to
an issue with you regarding this. For though <i>Palmerin of England</i>
is the best romance of those which recount the adventures of that line,
still it does not bear away the bell quite so easily as you say.
Indeed, its merits are not transcendently above those of its kind, and
its faults are of the same character. Again, true Spaniard as you are,
do you not praise it so greatly because you believe it to be the work
of a king? And do you not demean yourself to the level of a newspaper
critic when you doom to extinction those romances which you have not
read? Further, as a Castilian gentleman, do you agree with the
author&rsquo;s most despiteful entreatment of that sweet sex for whose
sake all romances were written? No good knight, no good man, could have
penned so many stupidities concerning their envy, their fickleness,
their lack of reason, as he has done; and still worse, he has made them
mere puppets, moving as the strings are pulled. For one thing I thank
him, however&mdash;his character of the magician Doliarte, a wise sage
dwelling in the Valley of Perdition, lost in contemplation of
mysterious things. Nay, for a greater thing I have to thank him also,
the colours of the marvellous, the intoxicating magic with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>which he has suffused his story; and if the rush
of it, the spell of it, transported you to the forests of Faery and
blinded you to the book&rsquo;s demerits, you are perhaps to be excused
if your enchanted eyes refused to behold them and saw only the outward
glamours of that rainbow world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"

<p class="first">The literary genius of Catalonia was unquestionably a
lyrical one, as befitted a province so happily endowed by nature,
clothed with the purple mantle of vineyards, and laved by the calm
beauty of a dreamy ocean. Epic has her home in rugged and wind-swept
lands, where the elemental trumpets of the air arouse the soul of man
to fiercer song and fill the memory with the clash of war. But on
sheltered strands, mellow with sun and painted in the ripe colours of
plenty, a softer and more dreamy music mimics the &aelig;olian sound of
the zephyrs which steal like melodious spirits through orchard and
vineyard. Yet this province of the Trovadores was not without its
legends of chivalric enterprise, and indeed produced two romances of
such intrinsic merit that they may be regarded as occupying an
unassailable position in the literature of the Peninsula.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3827" class="main">Partenopex de Blois</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The beautiful and highly finished romance of
<i>Partenopex de Blois</i> was written in the Catalonian dialect in the
thirteenth century, and printed at Tarragona in 1488. That the tale was
originally French is highly probable, but it is no mere translation,
and the treatment it has received in the course of adaptation has
undoubtedly made it a thing as wholly Catalonian as <i>The Cid</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>is Castilian. Here is the story of the knight
Partenopex.</p>
<p>On the death of the Emperor Julian of Greece the rule of his kingdom
devolved upon his daughter Melior, a maiden of extraordinary talents,
who was, moreover, possessed of a deep knowledge regarding the hidden
sciences. Notwithstanding her ability, however, her advisers did not
think it fitting that she should rule alone, and insisted that she
should address herself to the task of selecting a husband. They granted
her a space of two years in which to make choice of a suitable consort,
and in order that she might be able to select a <i>parti</i> of a rank
sufficiently illustrious to match with her own, she dispatched
embassies to all the principal courts of Europe, bidding their members
to inquire diligently into the credentials of all eligible princes.</p>
<p>At this time there lived in France a youth of much beauty and
promise in arms called Partenopex de Blois, nephew to the King of
Paris. While following the train of his royal uncle in the chase one
day, in the green shades of the Forest of Ardennes, he became separated
from the rest of the party and lost his way. Forced to spend the night
in the forest, he awoke with the dawn, and, in trying to find his
bearings, came to the seashore. To his surprise, he beheld a splendid
vessel moored near to the land. In the hope that its crew would be able
to direct him as to the path he should take to reach home, he went on
board the ship, but found her deserted. He was about to quit the vessel
when she began to move, and, gaining speed, cleaved the water with such
velocity that to attempt to leave her was impossible. After a voyage as
short as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>it was swift, Partenopex found himself moored in
a bay in a country of the most enchanting description.</p>
<p>Disembarking, the youth walked inland, and soon came to the walls of
a stately castle. He entered, and, to his surprise, found it as
deserted as the vessel which had brought him thither. The principal
chamber was illuminated by the sparkle of countless diamonds, and the
young knight, who was by this time famished with hunger, was pleased to
see an exquisite repast spread on the table before him. He was soon to
learn the magical nature of all things in that enchanted castle, for
the dainties with which the table groaned found their own way to his
lips, and when he had refreshed himself sufficiently a lighted torch
appeared as if suspended in the air, and preceded him to a bed-chamber,
where he was undressed by invisible hands.</p>
<p>As he lay in bed thinking upon the extraordinary nature of the
adventure which had befallen him a lady entered the apartment, and
introduced herself as Melior, the Empress of Greece. She told the young
knight that she had fallen in love with him from the account of her
ambassadors, and had contrived to bring him to her castle by dint of
the powers of magic she possessed. She commanded him to remain at the
castle, but warned him that if he attempted to see her again before two
years had elapsed the result would be the loss of her affection. She
then quitted the apartment, which was entered in the morning by her
sister Uracla, who brought him the most splendid apparel.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the mysterious castle of Melior Partenopex found no
lack of entertainment, for the extensive grounds by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>which it was surrounded afforded him the
pleasures of the chase, and in the evenings he was amused by the sweet
strains of invisible musicians. Everything possible and impossible was
done to render his stay pleasant and memorable. But in the midst of the
delights with which he was surrounded he learned that his country had
been attacked by a host of enemies. He communicated to his invisible
mistress his desire that he should be permitted to fight for the land
of his birth, and when she had received his assurance that he would
return she placed at his service the magic vessel in which he had come
to her coasts, and by its aid he shortly regained the shores of
France.</p>

alt="Partenopex in Melior&rsquo;s Chamber" width="492" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Partenopex in Melior&rsquo;s Chamber</p>
</div>
<p>Partenopex was making his way as quickly as possible to Paris to
place his sword at the service of his king, when he encountered a
knight whose conduct toward him brought matters to the arbitrament of a
combat. When they had fought for a space Partenopex discovered that his
opponent was none other than Gaudin, the lover of Uracla, the sister of
Melior, and from being at daggers drawn the two young knights became
the closest companions, and rode on together to where the Court sat at
Paris.</p>
<p>Shortly after his return to the capital Partenopex was presented to
the Lady Angelica, niece of the Pope, who promptly fell in love with
him. Animated by the mistaken belief that &lsquo;All&rsquo;s fair in
love,&rsquo; she intercepted his letters from Melior, and thus learned
of his passion for the wonder-working Empress of Constantinople.
Enlisting on her side a hermit of great sanctity, she bade him repair
to Partenopex and denounce his lady-love as a demon of darkness, who
was so lost to all good that she even partook of the outward semblance
of a fiend in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>possessing a serpent&rsquo;s tail, black skin,
white eyes, and red teeth. This story Partenopex stoutly refused to
credit, but when hostilities had come to an end and he had returned to
the enchanted castle the hermit&rsquo;s tale still agitated his mind,
and he resolved to put it to the test, for Melior had visited him in
the dark and he knew not how she appeared.</p>
<p>So one fateful night, when all the castle was plunged in slumber,
the young knight equipped himself with a lamp and made his way to the
chamber where he knew Melior slept. Entering softly, he held the lamp
above the form of his sleeping mistress, and when he beheld her warm
human beauty he knew that false slander had been spoken of her. But,
alas! as he gazed at her recumbent loveliness a drop of oil from the
lamp he held fell upon her bosom and she awoke. Furious that her
commands had been broken, she would have slain her unhappy lover on the
spot, but at the intercession of Uracla, who had entered the chamber on
hearing her sister&rsquo;s exclamations of anger, the incensed Empress
at last permitted him to depart without scathe.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Partenopex quitted the castle in all haste, and in
time came once more to the green shadows of Ardennes, where he resolved
to perish in strife with the savage beasts which haunted its dark
recesses. But although they devoured his steed they seemed unwilling to
encounter the knight himself. The neighings of his charger brought
Uracla, who had been searching for him, to the spot, and she succeeded
in inducing him to accompany her to her castle in Tenedos, there to
await a more complacent attitude on the part of her sister. Returning
to the wrathful Empress, she at last persuaded her to send forth a
decree that she would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href=
"#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>bestow her hand upon the victor in
a tournament she was about to proclaim.</p>
<p>Preparations for the tournament proceeded apace, and Partenopex
awaited the day in Uracla&rsquo;s castle in Tenedos. But he was not
permitted to remain in peace, for Parseis, one of Uracla&rsquo;s
maidens, conceived a passionate attachment to him, which she avowed to
him while they were taking a short trip in a boat. Partenopex, taken
aback, was about to protest, when the frail vessel was caught up by a
terrific tempest, and the pair were driven upon the coast of Syria. On
landing they were seized by the people of that country, who bore the
knight to their king, Hermon, and he was cast into prison.</p>
<p>A sad plight was that of Partenopex, for he heard that Hermon and
other knights had departed to the tournament of Melior at
Constantinople, while he had perforce to remain in durance vile and
renounce all hope of regaining his place in the affections of his lady
by force of arms.</p>
<p>But Partenopex succeeded in interesting the Queen in his affairs,
and she assisted in his escape from his Syrian prison. He arrived at
Constantinople just in time to participate in the tournament. Many and
powerful were his opponents, the most formidable being the Soldan of
Persia, but at length he overcame them all, and when he asked to be
permitted to claim his reward he was received by Melior with every mark
of forgiveness and rejoicing.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3883" class="main">The Type of
&lsquo;Partenopex&rsquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The romance of Partenopex is undoubtedly of the same
class as those of Cupid and Psyche and Melusine, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>which one spouse must not behold another on pain
of loss. The loss invariably occurs, but poetical justice usually
demands that recovery should take place after many trials. Frequently
the husband or wife takes beast or reptile shape, as in the grand old
romance of <i>Melusine</i>, to which <i>Partenopex</i> bears a strong
resemblance, and by which I think it has certainly been sophisticated.
But in the story with which we have been dealing the reputed
semi-reptilian form which the heroine is said to possess is proved to
be the figment of the brain of a jealous rival, and in this we have a
valuable variant of the main form of the legend, illustrating the rise
within it of more modern ideas and the skilful utilization of an
antique form to the uses of the writer of fiction. The tale of
<i>Partenopex de Blois</i> certainly deserves fuller study at the hands
of folklorists than it has yet received, and I hope they will peruse
its Catalonian as well as its French form, thus rendering their purview
of the tale more embracive.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3899" class="main">Tirante the White</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The grand old tale of <i>Tirante the White</i> was the
work of two Catalonian authors, Juan Martorell and Juan de Gilha, the
latter completing the work of the former. Martorell states that he
translated the romance from the English, and it certainly seems as if
portions of the work had been sophisticated or influenced by the old
English romance of <i>Sir Guy of Warwick</i>. I cannot, however,
discern any signs of direct translation, and think it very probable
that the author&rsquo;s statement in this regard is one of those polite
fictions employed by the romance-writers of Old Spain to render their
efforts more mysterious or to guard themselves against the merciless
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>critics with whom the Peninsula seems to have
swarmed in a period when well-nigh everybody was bitten with the craze
for <i lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>. The romance was first printed at
Valencia in 1490. It contains reference to the Canary Islands, which
were first discovered in 1326, and were not well known even in Spain
until the beginning of the fifteenth century, so that we may perhaps be
justified in fixing the date of its composition about that period,
especially as it alludes to a work on chivalry entitled <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;Arbre des Batailles</i>, which was not published until
1390. The book was translated into Castilian and produced at Valladolid
in 1511, and was followed by Italian and French translations by
Manfredi and the Comte de Caylus respectively, but the latter has
dreadfully mutilated the original, and has even altered its main plot
as well as many of its lesser incidents, and has imported into it an
unhealthy atmosphere which we do not find in the work as given us by
Martorell.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the marriage of a certain King of England with a
beautiful and accomplished princess of France the most extraordinary
efforts were made to signalize the <i>entente</i> thus ratified by a
tournament of the most splendid description. Learning of these martial
preparations, Tirante, a young knight of Brittany, resolved to
participate in them, and with a number of youthful companions who had a
like object in view he took ship for England, where in due time he
landed, and proceeded to Windsor. But the fatigues of the voyage
overtook him and he fell asleep, lulled into slumber by the jog-trot of
his weary charger.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that in this manner he became separated
from his brisker companions, and that on awaking he found himself alone
on the broad <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>highway. Setting spurs to his destrier, he
pushed on for a few miles, but feeling the necessity for rest and
refreshment he cast about for a halting-place, and was cheered by the
sight of a humble lodging, which he believed to be a hermitage,
nestling among the trees at some distance from the roadside and almost
concealed in the leafy shadows. Dismounting, he entered the place, and
was confronted by a person whose hermit&rsquo;s garb ill suited him,
and whose disguise was soon penetrated by the practised eye of
knighthood, so that Tirante was scarcely surprised to observe that the
recluse was engaged in reading the book known as <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;Arbre des Batailles</i>, a work which descants with
learning and insight upon the precepts and practice of chivalry.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e3930" class="main">The Hermit Earl</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The hermit was, indeed, none other than William, Earl
of Warwick, a renowned champion, who, tired of the frivolities of the
Court, had gone on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Arrived at the Holy
Sepulchre, he had spread a report of his death, had returned to England
in the disguise of a pilgrim or palmer, and had taken up his abode in
the hermitage where Tirante discovered him, and which was not far from
the castle where his countess resided. But his retirement was not
destined to last long, for when the great King of the Canary Islands
landed in England with a formidable army, the Earl, beholding the
widespread consternation occasioned by his invasion, took up arms once
more. The advance of the raiders was, however, so swift that the King
of England was speedily driven from Canterbury and London, and was
compelled to seek refuge in the town of Warwick, where he was hotly
besieged by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"
name="pb196">196</a>]</span>Canarese forces. At this crisis the Earl
came to his assistance, slew the King of the Canaries in single combat,
and dispersed his army in a pitched battle. This accomplished, he
revealed himself to his countess, and once more retired to his
hermitage. All of these details agree in a measure with those of the
old English romance of <i>Sir Guy of Warwick</i>.</p>
<p>Tirante made himself known to the hermit Earl, told him that he was
so called because his father was lord of the marches of Tirraine,
situated in that part of France which was opposite the coast of
England, and that his mother was daughter to the Duke of Brittany. He
further told his host that he was resolved to take part in the great
tournament held to celebrate the royal wedding, whereupon the Earl read
him a chapter from the book he had been perusing regarding the whole
duty of a knight. This he followed by a lecture upon the use of arms
and the exploits of ancient paladins. When he had finished he observed
that the hour was late and that as Tirante was ignorant of the roads he
had better hasten upon his way, and, pressing the youthful champion to
accept the book from which he had been reading, he bade him
farewell.</p>
<p>A twelvemonth passed. Tirante, having shown his superiority at the
tournament, was returning with some forty of his companions from the
Court, when they once more passed the Earl&rsquo;s retreat, and halted
to pay their duty to him. Interested to learn of the warlike pageant,
he inquired who had most distinguished himself, and was told that
Tirante had borne off the prize. A French lord called Villermes, having
objected to his wearing a favour given him by the fair Agnes, daughter
of the Duke of Berri, had defied him to mortal combat, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>had
required that they should fight armed with bucklers of paper and
helmets of flowers. Villermes was slain in the encounter, but Tirante,
having recovered from eleven wounds, shortly afterward slew four
knights, brothers-in-arms, who proved to be the Kings of Poland and
Friesland and the Dukes of Burgundy and Bavaria. A certain subject of
the King of Friesland, rejoicing in the name of Kyrie Eleison, or
&lsquo;Lord have mercy upon us,&rsquo; and descended from the ancient
giants, now arrived in England to avenge his master&rsquo;s death. On
beholding his sovereign&rsquo;s tomb, however, he expired from grief on
seeing the arms of Tirante suspended over the Frisian standard. His
place was supplied by his brother, Thomas of Montauban, a champion of
stature still more gigantic, who was, however, defeated by the young
Breton knight and forced to sue for his life.</p>
<p>Having paid his respects to the Earl, Tirante returned to his native
Brittany, but he had been only a few days in the castle of his fathers
when a messenger arrived with the news that the Knights of Rhodes were
closely besieged by the Genoese and the Soldan of Cairo. Accompanied by
Philip, youngest son of the King of France, Tirante set out to the
relief of the island, and in the course of the voyage anchored in the
roads of Palermo, where he sojourned for a space. When at length he
arrived at Rhodes the besiegers beat a hasty retreat, and having freed
the island from their presence Tirante and his men returned to Sicily,
where Prince Philip espoused the princess of that country.</p>
<p>But the wedding festivities had scarcely come to an end when a
herald from the Emperor of Constantinople arrived at the Sicilian Court
with the moving information that his master&rsquo;s territories had
been invaded by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198"
name="pb198">198</a>]</span>Grand Turk and the Soldan of the Moors.
Once more chivalric honour demanded that a Christian land should be
rescued from the clutches of the paynim, and Tirante, setting sail for
Constantinople, was, on his arrival there, entrusted with the supreme
command of the Hellenic forces. A great part of the romance is occupied
by the details of the war carried on against the Turks, who were
invariably defeated in battle after battle, so that at length they
called for a truce. This was granted, and the interval of repose was
occupied with splendid festivals and tournaments.</p>
<p>At this juncture of affairs no less a personage than the celebrated
Urganda arrived in Constantinople in quest of her brother, the renowned
Arthur, King of Britain. The Emperor, searching among those of his
prisoners who were kept in the most obscure dungeons, found the hero of
heroes pining out his old age in an iron cage, reduced to the lowest
level of physical debility. Restored to his ancient weapon, the good
sword Excalibur, the hapless monarch was able to answer any questions
put to him with address. But when the blade was withdrawn from his
grasp he sank ever lower into the second childhood of senility. After
giving a splendid supper, Urganda disappeared with her ancient brother,
nor was anyone aware whither they had gone.</p>
<p>Up to this time Tirante had contrived to remain fancy-free, but at
last he fell a willing victim to the bright eyes of the Emperor&rsquo;s
daughter, the Princess Carmesina. His affair went smoothly enough until
one of her attendants, Reposada, having fallen passionately in love
with the young knight, succeeded in arousing his jealousy by a wretched
stratagem, and, offended to the soul at what he believed to be the
baseness of his mistress, he set out <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>once more for the
army without taking his leave of her. But the vessel in which he set
sail was caught in a violent tempest and driven upon the coasts of
Africa. Wandering disconsolate on the shore, Tirante encountered an
ambassador of the King of Tormecen, who conducted him to Court and
presented him to his master, whom he assisted in the wars in which that
monarch was naturally engaged. On one occasion he besieged the city of
Montagata, when a lady issued from its gates to sue for peace on behalf
of its inhabitants. To his surprise he found her to be one of the
Princess Carmesina&rsquo;s attendants, who told him the truth regarding
the trick played upon him by the false Reposada. He at once raised the
siege, and returned to Constantinople at the head of an enormous army
to succour the Greek Emperor. Burning the Turkish fleet, he rendered
the retreat of the Soldan&rsquo;s forces impracticable, and secured an
advantageous peace.</p>
<p>Splendid preparations were now made for the wedding of Tirante and
Carmesina. But while on his return to Constantinople after the
conclusion of the treaty he received orders, at the distance of a
day&rsquo;s journey from the city, to wait until the completion of
those preparations before entering Constantinople. While walking on the
banks of a river in conversation with the Kings of Ethiopia, Fez, and
Sicily, he was seized with a deadly pleurisy, and, despite all the
efforts of his attendants, expired shortly afterward. The Emperor and
Princess, on learning of his demise, were unable to restrain their
grief, and died on the day they heard of his death.</p>
<p>We have at last encountered a romance which does not end happily. In
what manner such a <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> was received by the Spanish
public we know not, but at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>least they cannot but have been
struck by its originality. That <i>Tirante the White</i> was a popular
favourite, however, is clear from the praise lavished upon it
<span class="corr" id="xd19e3969" title="Not in source">by</span>
Cervantes. &ldquo;By her taking so many romances together,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;there fell one at the barber&rsquo;s feet, who had a mind
to see what it was, and found it to be <i>Tirante the White</i>.
&lsquo;God save me,&rsquo; quoth the priest in a loud voice, &lsquo;is
<i>Tirante the White</i> there? Give me him here, neighbour, for I
shall find him a treasure of delight, and a mine of
entertainment.&rsquo;&rdquo; He then advised the housewife to take it
home and read it, &ldquo;for though the author deserves to be sent to
the gallows for writing so many foolish things seriously, yet in its
way it is the best book in the world. Here the knights eat and sleep
and die in their beds, and make their wills before their death, with
several things which are wanting in all other books of this
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is not this the essence of the revolt against the unnatural
absurdities which so often characterized romance, expressed succinctly
by the man who headed the mutiny? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"

<p class="first">The tragic and tumultuous story of the manner in which
Spain was delivered into the hands of the Moors is surely a theme
worthy of treatment by the highest genius. But either because it
offended the national pride or otherwise failed to make an appeal to
the Castilian temperament, its epic remains unwritten. Few passages in
history afford such an opportunity for the delineation of the deeper
human passions as the episode which resulted in the betrayal of an
entire country for the gratification of a private wrong. It presents
such a catastrophe as urged &AElig;schylus to compose the moving and
majestic drama of <i>Electra</i>. Yet it has found no more potent
expression than in the dreary parchment of the latest Spanish chronicle
and the pedestrian verse of Southey&rsquo;s <i>Roderick, the Last of
the Goths</i>, which draws its inspiration from the pseudo-history of
that account.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e4009src" href="#xd19e4009"
name="xd19e4009src">1</a></p>
<p>Before we examine the romantic material embedded in <i>The Chronicle
of Don Roderic, with the Destruction of Spain</i>, it will be well to
trace the story of the downfall of the Gothic empire in Spain by the
aid of such materials as we can trust to supply us with a more or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>less accurate account of it. These are to be
found in the <i>General Chronicle of Spain</i> and in the pages of the
Moorish historians. Summarized, the facts relating to the incident are
probably as follows:</p>
<p>From the period of the settlement of the Mohammedan Arabs in
Mauretania their fleets had frequently ravaged the coasts of Andalusia,
by which name the entire Spanish peninsula was known to them. An enmity
arose between Spanish Goth and Moorish Arab which was heightened not
only by the difference in their religion but by the circumstance that
the fortress of Ceuta in Mauretania still remained in Gothic hands.
This outpost of the Gothic empire was held by the vigilance and courage
of Count Julian, a leader of experience, who retained the fortress
against tremendous odds.</p>
<p>The ruler of Spain at this period was one Don Roderic, who does not
appear to have held the throne by hereditary right. Witiza, his
predecessor, had slain Roderic&rsquo;s father, the governor of a
province, and, whether to gratify his revenge or purely because of his
ambitions, Roderic succeeded in having the claims of Witiza&rsquo;s two
sons set aside and in securing the crown for himself. But the monarchy
among the Goths of Spain was still elective, and it may be that Roderic
had been legally placed on the throne by the suffrages of his
fellow-peers. It is probable that Count Julian was a member of the
unsuccessful faction headed by the royal brothers, and that, in despair
of displacing Roderic by force of arms, he sought the assistance of his
Moorish enemies to accomplish his downfall.</p>
<p>But tradition, whether rightly or otherwise, disdains to accept the
circumstances of a cold political issue as an adequate reason for Count
Julian&rsquo;s defection from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>loyalty, and has a much more
romantic explanation to advance for his traitorous act. Roderic, we are
told, was a ruler of evil and scandalous character. He conceived a
violent passion for Cava, the young and beautiful daughter of Count
Julian, whom he abducted and dishonoured. Roused to fury and despair at
Roderic&rsquo;s act, Julian instantly resolved upon a terrible revenge,
and, not content with handing over the fortress which he had so long
maintained against a powerful enemy, he suggested to Musa, the Moorish
king or satrap, the invasion of Spain, binding himself even more
closely to the infidels by accepting their religion and conforming to
their customs. He impressed upon Musa the natural advantages of his
native land, and laid stress upon its distracted and defenceless
condition, the effeminacy and degeneracy of its warriors, and the
unprotected state of its cities. Musa recognized that an opportunity
offered itself to extend the Arab dominions, and sent an embassy to
Walid, the Caliph, his suzerain, asking his opinion of such an
enterprise. Walid encouraged him to proceed with it. But Musa, although
a brave and active leader, was shrewd and cautious, and instead of
launching a great armada against a country of whose defensive capacity
he knew little, contented himself in the first instance by making a
raid, in July a.d. 710, on the Spanish coast, as if to test the
fighting qualities of its defenders. The expedition consisted of only
five hundred men, who, landing at Tarifa, marched some eighteen miles
through Spanish territory to the castle and town of Julian. There they
were joined by the disaffected adherents of that nobleman, and, meeting
with no opposition, returned to Africa with an abundance of spoil.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>Encouraged by the success of their preliminary enterprise, the
Saracens now levied an army of five thousand men, and in the spring of
711, under the leadership of a certain Tarik, landed upon Spanish soil
at a spot which still bears the name of their commander, Gibraltar, for
Gebel al Tarik signifies &lsquo;the Mountain of Tarik.&rsquo; They
speedily defeated a Spanish force under Edeco, but Roderic, now fully
aroused to the danger by which his rule was threatened, summoned his
vassals to the royal standard, their number, we are told, amounting to
nearly one hundred thousand men. Tarik had by this time been
reinforced, but could muster only some twelve thousand troops of
Moorish race, though these were augmented by a host of Africans and
disaffected Goths. The armies met near Cadiz, Roderic himself leading
the Gothic host, resplendent in his princely robes of silk and gold
embroidery, and reclining in a car drawn by white mules. The Gothic
attack almost succeeded by sheer weight of numbers, and sixteen
thousand of the Moorish army were slain in the first encounter. But
Tarik encouraged his flagging forces by pointing out to them that
retreat was impossible. &ldquo;The enemy is before you,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the sea behind you. Whither would ye fly? Follow me, my
brethren. I shall trample on yon King of the Romans or
perish.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e4040" class="main">Roderic&rsquo;s Fate</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But assistance for the Moors was at hand, for the two
sons of Witiza, who occupied the most important posts in the Spanish
army, suddenly broke away from the main body. This brought about a
general panic. Roderic, mounting his fleet charger Orelia, was drowned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>while attempting to swim the Guadalquivir,
leaving his diadem and robes on the bank. At the instigation of Count
Julian, Tarik pressed on to Toledo, which, however, held out for three
months, and dispatched a force to reduce the kingdom of Granada. This
was duly accomplished, and Toledo surrendered on the Moor&rsquo;s
assurance that its inhabitants would be permitted to leave with their
possessions, a promise which was faithfully kept. The Jews, who had
especially assisted the pagan invaders, were richly rewarded by them,
and, indeed, formed an alliance with them which lasted until both were
eventually and happily expelled from the country. From Toledo Tarik
spread his conquests over Castile and Leon, penetrating north as far as
the town of Gijon in Asturias, where further progress was barred by the
waters of the Bay of Biscay. In a few months practically the whole of
Spain had become a Mohammedan province, and only a handful of Gothic
warriors were able to hold out in the valleys of Asturias against the
conquering Moor.</p>
<p>We may now leave the path of definite history for the more
picturesque if also more uncertain road of romance. The chronicles
recount Don Roderic&rsquo;s abandoned wickedness, and tell how the
invasion of the Moors, instigated by Julian, broke as a thunderclap
upon the unprincipled ruler. The strife with the Saracens is described,
and Roderic&rsquo;s flight is painted in gloomy colours. But just as
popular legend refused to credit the death of Arthur on that day at
Camelot, or the fate of James IV of Scotland on Flodden Field, or the
death of Harold at Hastings, so it refused to believe in that of
Roderic. Racial sentiment refuses to admit the death of a popular
leader, and have not legends been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206"
href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>afloat even in our own day
concerning the lamented Lord Kitchener?</p>
<p>Tradition<a class="noteref" id="xd19e4052src" href="#xd19e4052"
name="xd19e4052src">2</a> has it, then, that as Roderic was about to
plunge into the waters of the Guadalquivir a divine light burst upon
him, and a secret voice adjured him to repent of his sins and live.
Acting upon the advice of this inward counsellor, he divested himself
of his royal insignia, and taking from the dead the garment of a humble
peasant, stole from the field. All night he fled, haunted by fearful
visions of the wrath to come. On all sides he beheld the dreadful
consequences of his defeat. Staggering on through scenes of misery and
ruin which wrung his heart, he came at length, after seven days&rsquo;
travel, to the monastery of Canlin, on the banks of the river Ana, near
Minda. The place was deserted, but the wretched fugitive cast himself
down beside the altar to await his doom in prayer, for he fully
believed that sooner or later the infidels would trace him to this
retreat and dispatch him. He fed the lamps with oil, only leaving the
holy shrine from time to time to see if the Saracens approached.
Beneath the crucifix he lay, clasping the feet of the Redeemer&rsquo;s
image, and weeping icy tears of penitence. As he grovelled there he
became aware that some one had entered the chapel, and, raising his
eyes in hope of a speedy death by the <span class="corr" id="xd19e4067"
title="Source: scimetar">scimitar</span> of a Moorish soldier, to his
surprise he beheld a monk, who gently addressed him, and explained that
he had returned to the place which for threescore years and five he had
called home, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>trusting to die there by the hand of an infidel
and thus to gain the crown of a martyr.</p>
<p>Roderic revealed his name to the father, who, deeply impressed by
the tone of penitence in his voice, knelt beside him and ministered to
the stricken monarch throughout the long night hours. He assured him
that he must live to work out his salvation, and when morning broke the
aged priest and he who yesterday had been one of the proudest kings in
Christendom quitted the chapel and went on their way.</p>
<p>The holy father led the crownless King to a hermitage, where he gave
him further ghostly counsel, enjoining him to remain in that place so
long as it should please God. &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;on the third day from hence I shall pass out of this world, and
thou shalt bury me and take my garments and remain here for the space
of a year at least, that thou mayst endure hunger and cold and thirst
in the love of our Lord, that He may have compassion on
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the third day, as he had prophesied, the hermit expired. Deeply
grieved at his death, Roderic busied himself in carrying out his last
wishes, and with an oaken staff and his bare hands dug a grave for the
holy man&rsquo;s body. When he was in the act of laying him in the
ground he found a scroll in his hand covered with writing, addressed to
himself, and containing advice concerning the life he should lead while
an inmate of the hermitage. This Roderic reverently perused, and
resolved to follow its injunctions to the letter.</p>
<p>But the Father of Evil was not minded that the King should proceed
undisturbed in his quest for salvation, and that night appeared to him
as he was in the act of committing the hermit to the grave. He came in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>monkish garb, his features hooded by a great
cowl, and further disguised by a beard of venerable length and silvery
whiteness, supporting himself by a staff as if he were lame. Roderic
took him for a friend of the dead hermit, and would have kissed his
hand, but the Fiend drew back, saying: &ldquo;It is not meet that a
king should kiss the hand of a poor servant of God.&rdquo; The King,
hearing his identity thus revealed, believed the Devil to be a holy
man, speaking by aid of a revelation. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I am not a king, but a miserable sinner, who had better never
have been born, so much woe has visited the land through my
misdoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast not so much fault as thou thinkest,&rdquo; replied
Satan, &ldquo;for the calamity of which thou speakest would have
occurred in any case. It was ordained, and the fault was not thine. My
words are those of a spirit created by the will of God, and not mine
own.&rdquo; The Evil One then pretended that he had journeyed all the
way from Rome to help Roderic in his distress, and hearing this the
King rejoiced, and listened reverently as the Devil attempted to
controvert the teaching of the dead hermit by specious arguments. But
when the King requested the seeming holy man to assist him in burying
the anchorite&rsquo;s remains he was surprised to see him turn and make
off at a good speed, despite his alleged lameness.</p>
<p>At the hour of noon next day the Devil returned with a basket full
of savoury food. But the dead hermit had enjoined Roderic to eat of
nothing but the rye bread which the shepherds would bring him once a
week, and obedient to this, he withstood the tempter&rsquo;s proffered
meat and wine. The argument betwixt the King and Satan is then
elaborated with medieval prolixity and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>due regard to the
hair-splitting, logic-chopping theology of the time. Even a medieval
sense of decency might have prompted the writer to omit the
King&rsquo;s interview with the Holy Ghost, as to which I will only say
here that at the word of the Holy Spirit the foul fiend fled in the
shape of a horrid devil, bristling with the insignia of hell.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e4089" class="main">Satan&rsquo;s Stratagem</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But the Enemy was not yet finished with Don Roderic,
for one evening at set of sun the hermit King saw one approach with a
great power of armed men and every display of pomp and circumstance. As
the train drew nearer, Roderic, to his amazement, beheld in its leader
Count Julian, who came to him and would have kissed his hand with every
sign of homage, offering himself up to the King&rsquo;s vengeance and
justice, and freely acknowledging his treason. The seeming Julian
begged him to rise up and take once more his proper place at the head
of the Spanish forces, so that the infidel might be thrust out of
Spain. But Roderic, suspecting another fiendish stratagem, shook his
head, and requested Julian to accept the leadership of the Gothic army
himself, as his vows did not permit him to engage any longer in worldly
affairs. Julian turned to the great company behind him, among whom
Roderic beheld many whom he had thought to have been slain in battle,
and these enthusiastically seconded their leader&rsquo;s arguments. But
when the fiendish crew saw that their pleading was without avail they
withdrew to the plain below, where they formed themselves in battle
array, as if awaiting the onset of an enemy. And lo! against them came
a multitude of seeming pagans, so that a great and fierce <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>carnage followed. To the anxious eyes of the
King, those who represented the Christian host seemed to put the paynim
to the rout, and messengers spurred to the hermitage, announcing to him
that his people had gained a glorious victory. But as the cock crowed
the whole pageant of battle passed away like smoke borne before the
breeze, and the King knew that he had once more withstood the wiles of
the Enemy.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Don Roderic is tempted by a Semblance of Cava</p>
</div>
<p>Now for three months the Devil refrained from tormenting Don
Roderic, but at the end of that time he sent upon him a more grievous
trial than any that had gone before. As he was saying his prayers at
the hour of vespers, he beheld a train of cavaliers ride up to the
hermitage, and when they halted and alighted there came toward him a
damsel in the guise of that Cava, the daughter of Count Julian, whom he
had so foully wronged. At sight of her the wretched man&rsquo;s heart
almost ceased to beat, but ere he could speak she told him that her
father had turned his sword on the Moors and had conquered them, that
Eliaca, his Queen, was no more, and that a holy man had told her that
she must forthwith find Don Roderic and wed with him, and that she
should bring forth a son called Elbersan, who should bring the whole
world under the sceptre of Spain.</p>
<p>When Roderic heard these words he trembled exceedingly, for greatly
had he loved Cava. She ordered a pavilion to be pitched near the
hermitage, and her train set out a sumptuous repast. Seeing how
beautiful she was, the King shook as with a palsy. But he clasped his
hands and, commending himself to God, begged to be delivered from
temptation. As he made the sign of the Cross the false Cava fled
shrieking, and her infernal train followed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>with
such a rout and noise that the whole world seemed to be falling to
pieces. Once more the Holy Spirit admonished Roderic to guard against
such stratagems of the Devil, and far into the day the repentant but
victorious King prayed without ceasing in thanksgiving for his
deliverance from the snares of hell.</p>

<p class="first">The time now came when it was appointed that the King
should leave the retreat where he had passed through trials so many and
so terrible, and, following a cloud appointed for his guidance, he
girded up his loins and set forth on his journey. Before nightfall of
the first day he came to another hermitage, where he lodged during the
hours of darkness. After two days&rsquo; journeying he came to a place
unnamed, which was destined to be that of his burial. The Elder of this
place told him that he must go to a fountain below the hermitage in
which he had taken up his abode, and that he should there find a smooth
stone. This he was instructed to raise, when he would find below it
three little serpents, one having two heads. This two-headed serpent he
must place in a jar and nourish secretly, so that none should know of
its existence, and so hide it until it grew large enough to wind its
coils three times within the jar and put its head out. Then he must
place it in a tomb and lie down himself with it, naked, for such, it
pleased God, should be his penance, according to a voice the Elder had
heard speaking in the church of that place.</p>
<p>Roderic scrupulously followed the Elder&rsquo;s injunctions, found
the reptile, and waited patiently till the two-headed serpent had waxed
great within the jar. Then, in company with the Elder, he divested
himself of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>raiment and sought the tomb, wherein he laid
himself down. And when he had done so the Elder took a lever and laid a
great stone upon the top. Having lain there three days, during which
the Elder prayed and watched devoutly, the serpent raised its heads and
began with one head to devour his sinful nature and with the other to
eat his heart. In great torment did Roderic lie in that place. But at
length the serpent broke through the web of the heart, so that
incontinently the King gave up his spirit to God, Who by His holy mercy
took him into His glory. And at the hour when he expired all the bells
of the place rang of themselves, as if they had been rung by the hands
of men.</p>
<p>So, in the strange spirit of medieval mysticism, ends the piteous
legend of Don Roderic of Spain. Who shall unriddle the weird
significance of its close, unless, like old Thomas Newton in his
<i>Notable History of the Saracens</i>, they believe &ldquo;that the
serpent with two heads signifieth his sinful and gylty
conscience&rdquo;? <i>Requiescas in pace, Domine Roderice!</i>

Moor&rdquo; &ldquo;Gayferos&rdquo; and &ldquo;Count Alarcos&rdquo;</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I bracket these three romances together in this
chapter not only because they appear to have been held in the highest
favour by the people of Old Spain, but for the equally good reason that
they seem to me to manifest the national taste and genius more markedly
than others of the same class, if, indeed, they did not belong to a
class by themselves, as I have always suspected they did, for in all
Castilian accounts of romantic fiction they are frequently mentioned
together, and this traditional treatment of them may arise from the
consciousness of their similarity of <i>genre</i>. But above and beyond
this they possess and enshrine that grave and austere spirit so typical
of all true Spanish literature, and at least one of them is deeply
tinged with the atmosphere of fatal and remorseless tragedy which only
the Latin or the Hellene knows how to evoke, for not the greatest
masters of the Northern races, neither Marlowe nor Massinger, Goethe
nor Shakespeare, can drape such sombre curtains around their stage as
Calderon or Lope.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e4133" class="main">Calaynos</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Calaynos, one of the most renowned of the Moorish
knights, is the hero of more than one romance in verse. But that which
is best known, and most regular in its sequence of events, is the
<i>Coplas de Calainos</i>, which has been translated so successfully by
Lockhart in his <i>Spanish Ballads</i>. The Moorish champion, it tells
us, was enamoured of a maiden of his own nation, and in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>order to win her favour offered her broad
estates and abundant wealth. But in her petulance she refused this
comfortable homage, and demanded the heads of three of the most valiant
champions of Christendom&mdash;Rinaldo, Roland, and Oliver! Bestowing
on his lady a farewell kiss, Calaynos immediately set out for Paris,
and when he had arrived there displayed the crescent banner of his
faith before the Church of St John. He caused a blast to be blown upon
his trumpet, the sound of which was well known to Charlemagne and his
twelve peers, and was heard by them as they hunted in the greenwood,
some miles from the city. Shortly afterward the royal train encountered
a Moor, and the Emperor haughtily demanded of him how he dared to show
his green turban within his dominions. He replied that he served
Calaynos, who sent his defiance to Charlemagne and all his peers, whose
onset he awaited at Paris.</p>
<p>As they rode back to encounter the bold infidel Charlemagne
suggested to Roland that he should take the chastisement of Calaynos
upon himself, but that haughty paladin proposed that the task should be
delegated to some carpet-knight, as he considered it beneath his
prowess to do battle with a single Moor. Sir Baldwin, Roland&rsquo;s
nephew, boasted that he would bring Calaynos&rsquo; green turban to the
dust, and, spurring ahead, soon came face to face with the stern
Moorish lord, who, with a sneer, offered to take him into the service
of his lady as a page.</p>
<p>Right angry was Baldwin when he heard these words, and, hurling his
defiance at Calaynos, bade him prepare for battle. The Moor vaulted
upon his barb, and, levelling his lance, rode fiercely at Baldwin and
bore him to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>earth, where he made him sue for mercy. But
Roland, the youth&rsquo;s uncle, was at hand, and, winding his terrible
horn, shouted to Calaynos to prepare for combat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; asked Calaynos. &ldquo;Thou wearest a
coronet in thy helm, but I know thee not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No words, base Moor!&rdquo; replied Roland. &ldquo;This hour
shall be thy last,&rdquo; and, so saying, he charged his enemy at full
speed. Down crashed the haughty infidel, and Roland, leaping from the
saddle, stood over him, drawn sword in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy name, paynim,&rdquo; he demanded; &ldquo;speak or
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Calaynos, &ldquo;I serve a haughty maiden
of Spain, who would have no gift of me but the heads of certain peers
of Charlemagne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; laughed Roland. &ldquo;Fool that thou art, she
could not have loved thee when she bade thee beard our fellowship. Thou
hast come here to thy death,&rdquo; and with these words he smote off
Calaynos&rsquo; head, and spurned his crescent crest in twain.
&ldquo;No more shall this moon rise above the meads of Seine,&rdquo; he
cried, as he sheathed his falchion.</p>
<p>Thus was Calaynos fooled by a maiden&rsquo;s pride and by his own.
The story is, of course, wildly improbable, and that a Moorish knight
could have reached Paris on such a quest is unthinkable. But the tale
has a very human accent, and is not without its moral.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e4164" class="main">Gayferos</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Gayferos was a figure dear to Spanish romance. His
story was connected with the Charlemagne cycle, and was included in the
pseudo-chronicle of Archbishop Turpin, but, though a knight of France,
he appears to have possessed a special attraction for the Castilian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>mind, owing, probably, to the circumstance of
his seven years&rsquo; search for his wife in Spanish territory.</p>
<p>Gayferos of Bordeaux was a kinsman of Roland, the invincible hero of
the <i lang="fr">chansons de gestes</i>, and husband of
Charlemagne&rsquo;s daughter Melisenda. Shortly after their marriage
the lady was kidnapped by the Saracens and confined in a strong tower
at Saragossa. Determined to rescue her from pagan custody, Gayferos set
out in search of his wife, but after spending seven long years in
diligent inquiry failed to locate the place where she was imprisoned.
From province to province, from castle to castle of sunny Spain he
journeyed, until at length, disconsolate and dejected, he returned to
Paris.</p>
<p>In the hope of drowning the remembrance of his loss, Gayferos
plunged into the recreations of the Court. One day as he played dice
with the Emperor&rsquo;s admiral, Charlemagne, seeing him thus
employed, said to him: &ldquo;How is it, Gayferos, that you waste your
time on a paltry game, while your wife, my daughter, languishes in a
Moorish prison? Were you as ready to handle arms as to throw dice, you
would hasten to the rescue of your lady.&rdquo; The Emperor&rsquo;s
speech was unmerited, for he had only just learned of the place in
which Melisenda was held in durance, whereas the faithful Gayferos was
not yet aware of it. But gathering from Charlemagne the name of the
castle in which she was confined, he made speed to his uncle Roland,
and begged him for armour and a horse.</p>
<p>Roland, seeing the dismay in which his nephew was plunged, pressed
upon him his own famous arms and his favourite charger, and, thus
equipped, Gayferos once more turned his face to the land of Spain. In
due time he arrived at Saragossa, and, meeting with no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>opposition at its gates, he entered and rode
straight to the house where his captive wife lay. Beholding him from
the window, she begged him as he was a Christian knight to send the
tidings of her to her husband Gayferos.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Seven summers, seven winters have I waited in
this tower,</p>
<p class="line">While my lord Gayferos holdeth dalliance in hall and
bower;</p>
<p class="line">Hath forgotten Melisenda, hopes that she hath wed the
Moor;</p>
<p class="line">Yet the kindness of his memory shall I cherish
evermore.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Stands the champion in his stirrups. &ldquo;Lady, dry
the useless tear,</p>
<p class="line">For thy husband and thy lover, thy devoted knight is

<p class="line">Spring to saddle from the casement, leap into my fond
embrace</p>
<p class="line">That shall hold thee and enfold thee from the Moor and
all his race.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Leaping from the casement into the arms of her
faithful knight, Melisenda placed herself on the saddle before him, and
setting spurs to his horse Gayferos made all speed to reach the gates.
But a Moor who had witnessed the rescue gave the alarm, and soon the
fugitives found themselves pursued by seven columns of horsemen.</p>
<p>The pursuers pressed hard upon them, but at the critical juncture
Melisenda recognized the horse on which they rode to be Roland&rsquo;s,
and remembered that by loosening the girth, opening the breastplate,
and driving the spurs into its sides it could be made to leap across
any barrier with complete safety to those it carried. She hastily
informed her husband of this, and, acting as she directed, he drove the
steed toward the city wall, which it cleared with ease. On seeing this
the Moors very naturally gave up the chase. In due time Gayferos and
his wife returned to Paris, and their future was as bright as their
past had been clouded. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href=

<h3 id="xd19e4206" class="main">Count Alarcos</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Gloomy with the hangings of tragedy is the grim story
of <i>The Count Alarcos</i>, an anonymous romance, distinguished by
great richness of composition. It has been translated into English by
both Lockhart and Bowring, with but little distinction in either case,
having consideration to the moving character of the original. The story
opens with the simplicity which marks high tragedy. The Infanta Soliza,
daughter of the King of Spain, had been secretly betrothed to Count
Alarcos, but was abandoned by him for another lady, by whom he had
several children. In the agony of her grief and shame at her seduction
and desertion, the miserable princess shut herself off from the world,
and consumed the summer of her days in sorrow and bitter
disappointment. Her royal father, not conscious of the manner in which
she had been betrayed, questioned her as to the meaning of her grief,
and she answered him that she mourned because she was not a wife, like
other ladies of her station.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Count Alarcos meets his Wife and Children at the
Gate of the Castle</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;this fault is none
of mine. Did not the noble Prince of Hungary offer you his hand? I know
of no suitable husband for you in this land of Spain, saving the Count
Alarcos, and he is already wed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Infanta, &ldquo;it is the Count Alarcos
who has broken my heart, for he vowed to wed me, and plighted his troth
to me long ere he wedded. He is true to his new vows, but has left his
earlier oaths unfulfilled. In word and deed he is my
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space the King sat silent. &ldquo;Great wrong has been done,
my daughter,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;for now is the royal line
of Spain shamed in all men&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then dark and murderous jealousy seized upon the soul of the
Infanta. &ldquo;Certes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;this Countess can die.
Must I be shamed that she should live? Let it be bruited abroad that
sickness cut short her life. Thus may Count Alarcos yet wed
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exasperated by the thought of his daughter&rsquo;s dishonour, the
King summoned Alarcos to a banquet, and when they were alone broached
the subject of his perfidy to the Infanta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Don Alarcos,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that you
plighted your troth to my daughter and deceived her? Now hearken: your
Countess usurps my daughter&rsquo;s rightful place. She must die. Nay,
start not! It must be reported that sickness has carried her off. Then
must you wed the Infanta. You have brought your King to dishonour, and
he now demands the only reparation that it is within your power to
make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot deny that I deceived the Infanta,&rdquo; replied
Alarcos. &ldquo;But I pray you, in mercy spare my innocent lady. Visit
my sin upon me as heavily as you will, but not upon her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be,&rdquo; replied the stern old King. &ldquo;She
dies, I say, and that to-night. When the escutcheon of a king is
stained, it matters not whether the blood that washes the blot away be
guilty or innocent. Away, and do my behest, or your life shall pay the
forfeit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terrified at the thought of a traitor&rsquo;s death, for such an end
was more dreaded than any other by the haughty Castilian nobles,
Alarcos agreed to abide by the King&rsquo;s decision, and rode homeward
in an agony of remorse and despair. The thought that he must be the
executioner of the wife whom he dearly loved, the mother of his three
beautiful children, drove him to madness, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>and when at last he
met her at the gate of his castle, accompanied by her infants, and
displaying every sign of joy at his return, he shrank from her
caresses, and could only mutter that he had bad news, which he would
divulge to her in her bower.</p>
<p>Taking her youngest babe, she led him to her apartment, where supper
was laid. But the Count Alarcos neither ate nor drank, but laid his
head upon the board and wept bitterly out of a breaking heart. Then,
recalling his dreadful purpose, he barred the doors, and, standing with
folded arms before his lady, confessed his sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long since I loved a lady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I plighted
my troth to her, and vowed to love her like a husband. Her father is
the King. She claims me for her own, and he demands that I make good
the promise. Furthermore, alas that I should say it! the King has
spoken your death, and has decreed that you die this very
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Countess, amazed. &ldquo;Are these
then the wages of my loyal love for you, Alarcos? Wherefore must I die?
Oh, send me back to my father&rsquo;s house, where I can live in peace
and forgetfulness, and rear my children as those of thy blood should be
reared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be,&rdquo; answered the wretched Count. &ldquo;I
have pledged mine oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friendless am I in the land,&rdquo; cried the miserable lady.
&ldquo;But at least let me kiss my children ere I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou mayst kiss the babe upon thy breast,&rdquo; groaned
Alarcos. &ldquo;The others thou mayst not see again. Prepare
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doomed Countess kissed her babe, muttered an <i>Ave</i>, and,
rising from her knees, begged her merciless lord to be kind to their
children. She pardoned her husband, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>laid upon the King
and his daughter the awful curse known to the people of the Middle Ages
as &ldquo;the Assize of the Dying,&rdquo; so often taken advantage of
by those who were falsely accused and condemned to die, and by virtue
of which the victim summoned his murderers to meet him before the
throne of God ere thirty days were past and answer for their crime to
their Creator.</p>
<p>The Count strangled his wife with a silken kerchief, and when the
horrid deed had been done, and she lay cold and dead, he summoned his
esquires, and gave himself up to a passion of woe.</p>
<p>Within twelve days the revengeful Infanta perished in agony. The
merciless King died on the twentieth day, and ere the moon had
completed her round Alarcos too drooped and died. Cruel and inevitable
as Greek tragedy is the tale of Alarcos. But while perusing it and
under the spell of its tragic pathos we can scarcely regard it as of
the nature of legend, and we know not whom to abhor the most&mdash;the
revengeful Princess, the cruel King, or the coward husband who
sacrificed his innocent and devoted wife to the shadow of that
aristocratic &lsquo;honour&rsquo; which has to its discredit almost as
great a holocaust of victims as either superstition or fanaticism.

<h2 id="xd19e4265" class="main">Chapter IX: The Romanceros or
Ballads</h2>
<div class="epigraph">
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Iliads without a Homer.</p>
</div>
<p class="first xd19e562"><span class="sc">Lope de Vega</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The word <i>romancero</i> in modern Spanish is more or
less strictly applied to a special form of verse composition, a
narrative poem written in lines of sixteen syllables which adhere to
one single assonance throughout. Originally the term was applied to
those dialects or languages which were the offspring of the Roman or
Latin tongue&mdash;the spoken language of old Rome in its modernized
forms. Later it came to imply only the written forms of those
vernaculars, and lastly the poetic lyrico-narrative form alone, as
above indicated. The <i>romancero</i> therefore differs from the
romance in that it is written in verse, and it is plain from what has
just been said that the name &lsquo;romance&rsquo; was the product of
the transition period when the term was intended to describe the
written output of the more modern forms of Latin-Castilian, Portuguese,
French, and Proven&ccedil;al, whether couched in prose or verse. We
have seen that practically all the romances proper, as apart from the
<i>cantares de gesta</i>&mdash;that is, such compositions as
<i>Amadis</i>, <i>Palmerin</i>, and <i>Partenopex</i>&mdash;were
written in prose. But the <i>romancero</i> was first and last a
narrative in verse. Indeed, the three tales recounted in the last
chapter are of the <i>romancero</i> type&mdash;a form, as we shall see,
which gained quite as strong a hold upon the lower classes of the
Peninsula as the romance proper did upon the affections of the
<i>hidalgo</i> and the <i>caballero</i>. In a word, the
<i>romancero</i> is the popular ballad of Spain. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a previous chapter I attempted to outline the several types of
the Spanish ballad, or <i>romancero</i>, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Those of spontaneous popular origin and early date.</li>
<li>(2) Those based upon passages in the chronicles or <i lang=
"es">cantares de gesta</i>.</li>
<li>(3) Folk-ballads of a relatively late date.</li>
<li>(4) Those later ballads which were the production of conscious
art.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can thus class Spanish ballads more broadly into:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Those of popular origin.</li>
<li>(2) Those which have their rise in literary sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>As regard class (1) of the first quaternion, like Sancho Panza I
have no intention of indicating how old these may be. The fiercest
controversy has raged round this question, but, as I have already
indicated, it would be strange indeed if no vestiges of early Castilian
folk-song had come down to us in an altered form. Folk-song, in my
view, has as great a chance of survival as custom or legend, and we
know how persistent these are in undisturbed areas, so I see no reason
to doubt that a certain number of the original ballads of Spain have
come down to us in such an altered form as would, perhaps, render them
unrecognizable to their makers, just as the ancient Scottish romance of
<i>Thomas the Rhymer</i> would not have been recognized in its later
form by the singer who composed it.</p>
<p>All the arguments, arch&aelig;ological and philological, erected and
advanced by mere erudition will not convince me to the contrary. To
some people antiquity is a living <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"
href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>thing, a warm and glowing
environment, a world with the paths and manners of which they are
better acquainted than with the streets of every day. To others it
is&mdash;a museum. I have no quarrel with the curators of that museum,
and I enjoy reading their books&mdash;records of a land which few of
them have visited. But when they insist upon controverting the evidence
supplied by senses which they do not possess they become merely
tiresome. Like art, arch&aelig;ology has also its inspirations, its
higher vision. Alas that those who do not share it should attempt to
justify their conclusions by lifeless logic alone!</p>
<p>Therefore I shall say no more concerning the age of the ballads of
Old Spain, but will only remark with Sancho that &ldquo;they are too
old to lie.&rdquo; I have clearly shown, too, that a number of them
were based on passages in the chronicles and <i>cantares</i>, a
circumstance which in itself vouches for their relative antiquity. With
the later artificial imitations of G&oacute;ngora and Lope de Vega, and
others of similar stamp, we are not concerned here. After all, we can
only take the ballads of Spain as we find them in the
<i>cancioneros</i>. It is much too late in the day now to do anything
else. Like the ballads of Scotland and Denmark, those of Spain have
been collected and published for centuries, and in the pages of the
<i>cancioneros</i> old and new, popular and literary, are mingled
together in almost inextricable confusion. Let us glance, then, at the
history of these <i>cancioneros</i>, these treasure-houses of a
people&rsquo;s poetry, and attempt to realize their plan and scope as
perhaps the best method by which to approach the subject of the Spanish
ballad generally. Having done this, we can then discuss matters of
origin with critics of insight and sympathy. <span class=

<h3 id="xd19e4363" class="main">The &ldquo;Cancionero
General&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If we except the fragmentary collection of Juan
Fern&aacute;ndez de Constantina, the <i>Cancionero General</i>, or
&ldquo;Universal Song-book,&rdquo; as it might be translated, was
originally brought together and published at the beginning of the
sixteenth century by a certain Fernando del Castillo. The arrangement
of the ballads it contains is neither chronological nor thoroughly
systematic, although the productions of each author are kept distinct.
Later editions of this work quickly multiplied, and as the collection
extended the additions were always inserted at the end of the book. The
collection consists for the most part of the ballads of authors of the
fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, such as Tallante, Nicolas
N&uacute;&ntilde;ez, Juan de Mena, Porticarrero, and the still earlier
Marquis de Santillana.</p>
<p>The first portion of the work is confined to the spiritual songs
(<i lang="es">obras de devoci&oacute;n</i>). These are monotonous and
informed with a rigid fanaticism. Nor are the &ldquo;Moral Poems&rdquo;
which follow any more attractive, allegorizing virtues and vices
according to the definitions of scholastic philosophy. The amatory
verses in the collection are more ingenious than truly poetic; they
lack true feeling, and appear stiff and artificial in their reiteration
of burning passion and the overwhelming woes of unrequited love,
mingled with pseudo-philosophical appeals to reason. But gay and
graceful love songs are not lacking, as, for example, the
&ldquo;<span lang="es">Muy m&aacute;s clara que de luna</span>&rdquo;
of Juan de Meux or the &ldquo;<span lang="es">Pensamienti, pues
mostrays</span>&rdquo; of Diego Lopez de Haro. But these trail off into
philosophical disquisition, and the tender sentiment in which they were
conceived and commenced is lost in the shallows of paltry argument.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=

<p>Much more promising are the <i lang="es">canciones</i>, or lyrical
poems of a semi-conventional cast, which have a character and metrical
form all their own. They usually consist of twelve lines, divided into
two parts. The first four lines comprehend the idea on which the song
is founded, and this is developed or applied in the eight succeeding
lines. The <i lang="es">Cancionero General</i> contains one hundred and
fifty-six of these little songs, some of which are the best poems
contained in it, and perhaps they owe their excellence to the verbal
restraint which their form compels. An allied form is the <i lang=
"es">villancico</i>, or conceit, usually of three or four lines, a
fugitive piece, enshrining some fleeting emotion, and often packed with
the matter of poesy.</p>

General&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The title <i lang="es">Romancero General</i> was
applied to many collections of Spanish songs and narrative romances in
verse published during the seventeenth century and later. Of these only
the older require illustration here. The first in point of date was the
collection of Miguel de Madrigal, published in 1604, although another
work containing upward of a thousand romances and songs was produced in
the same year, and bears the same title. Another collection of primary
importance is that of Pedro de Flores (1614). This is obviously a
bookseller&rsquo;s compilation, but is none the worse for that, save
that it pretends to embrace the entire sum of Spanish <i lang=
"es">romanceros</i>, whereas it contains not one of those appearing in
the <i lang="es">Cancionero General</i>. All of these works contain
numerous amatory poems of the kind so liberally exemplified in the
<i lang="es">Cancionero General</i>, but with these we have little
concern, and our attention <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href=
"#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>may be better employed in
examining the <i lang="es">romanceros</i> proper which it contains.
These for the most part would seem to belong to the fifteenth century,
and relate to the civil wars of Granada, the last Moorish principality
in Spain, and the heroic and gallant adventures of Moorish knights. It
is, indeed, in this work that we first perceive the trend toward a
literary fashion in things Moorish to which we have referred in a
previous chapter, but, as has been indicated, this is very far from
saying that these poems owe their origin to Moorish models. But there
are not wanting Castilian themes and stories, such as those relating to
Roderic, Bernaldo de Carpio, Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez, the
Infantes of Lara, and the Cid. Most of these were written by men of
humble station, the true poets of the people, the late representatives
of those <i lang="es">juglares</i> who had sung or recited the <i lang=
"es">cantares de gesta</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e4422src" href=

<p>Mr James Fitzmaurice Kelly is at once the best informed and most
sympathetic of modern critics on the subject of the <i lang=
"es">romancero</i>. In his admirable <i>Chapters on Spanish
Literature</i>, a delightful series of excursions into several of the
most interesting provinces of Spanish letters, he reviews the <i lang=
"es">romancero</i> in some forty vivid pages, remarkable alike for
critical insight and the sanity of the conclusions to which they point.
Taking Lockhart&rsquo;s <i>Spanish Ballads</i> as a basis for comment,
he addresses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>himself to the racy criticism of the collection
of the Scottish translator. A better plan for the initiation of the
English-speaking reader into the mysteries of the <i lang=
"es">romancero</i> could scarcely be conceived, for there are few who
possess no acquaintance with Lockhart&rsquo;s work, one of the most
persistent of the drawing-room books of Victorian days. Following Mr
Kelly&rsquo;s admirable lead, then, though not in the spirit of base
imitation, let us take Lockhart as our &lsquo;document&rsquo; and
examine the more interesting of his translations, not only as regards
their subject-matter, but their excellences and shortcomings, comparing
them also with those of Bowring and others. Following Depping, Lockhart
divides his volume of ballads into three sections: Historical, Moorish,
and Romantic. With the first two groups of poems, or rather with their
subject-matter&mdash;those relating to King Roderic and Bernaldo de
Carpio&mdash;we have dealt elsewhere.</p>

Christian virgins should annually be delivered into his hands. King
Ram&iacute;ro refused to comply with such a shameful custom, and
marched to meet the Moor. A two days&rsquo; battle was fought near
Alveida, and at the conclusion of the first day&rsquo;s hostilities the
superior discipline of the Saracens had told heavily against the
Castilians. During the night, St Iago, the patron saint of Spain,
appeared to the King in a vision and promised his aid in the field next
day. With morning the battle was joined once more, the Saint, true to
his word, led the Spanish charge, and the Saracens were cast into
headlong rout. The maiden tribute was never afterward paid.

<p class="first">&ldquo;The Escape of the Count Fern&aacute;n
Gonz&aacute;lez, which is based on the old <i lang="es">Estoria del
noble caballero Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez</i>,&rdquo; a popular
arrangement of the <i lang="es">Cr&oacute;nica General</i> (1344), is
later than two other ballads which Mr Kelly and others believe
represent a lost epic which was worked into the <i lang=
"es">Cr&oacute;nica</i> in question. A wealth of legend certainly
clustered round the name of this cavalier, and he has a string of
<i lang="es">romanceros</i> to his credit. But are we to believe that
in every case where ballads crystallize round a great name these are
the broken lights of a disintegrated epic, worn down by attrition into
popular songs? Is there, indeed, irrefragable proof that such a process
ever took place anywhere? Or its reverse, for that matter? Practical
writers of verse (if a writer of verse can be practical) do not take
kindly to the hypothesis. They recognize the generic differences
between the spirit of epic and that of folk-poetry, and prefer to
believe that when both have fixed upon the same subject the choice was
fortuitous and not necessarily evolutionary.</p>
<p>Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez of Castile owed not a little of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>romantic reputation to his wife, who delivered
him from captivity on at least two occasions. On that celebrated in the
ballad she played the part of a faithful lover and a true heroine.
Gonz&aacute;lez, taken by his enemies, had been carried to a stronghold
in Navarre. A Norman knight passing through that country requested the
governor of the castle for an audience with the captive, and as he
offered a suitable bribe the official gladly conceded the request. The
interview over, the knight departed and sought the palace of King
Garcia of Navarre, who held Gonz&aacute;lez in bondage. One of the
counts against the prisoner seems to have been that he had asked Garcia
for the hand of his daughter, and to this princess, who secretly loved
the captive, the knight now addressed himself:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Moors may well be joyful, but great should be our
grief,</p>
<p class="line">For Spain has lost her guardian when Castile has lost
her chief.</p>

land:</p>

</div>
<p class="first">At &lsquo;mirk of night&rsquo; the Infanta rose, and,
proceeding alone to the castle where Gonz&aacute;lez was confined,
proffered such a heavy bribe to the governor to set him at liberty that
he permitted his prisoner to go free. But the hero was still hampered
by his chains, and when the pair were stopped by a hunter-priest who
threatened to reveal their whereabouts to the King&rsquo;s foresters
unless the Infanta paid him a shameful ransom, Gonz&aacute;lez was
unable to punish him as he deserved. But as the wretch embraced the
princess she seized him by the throat, and Gonz&aacute;lez grasped the
spear which he had let fall and drove it through his body. Shortly
afterward they encountered a band of Gonz&aacute;lez&rsquo; own
men-at-arms, with which incident their night of adventure came to a
close. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=

<h3 id="xd19e4511" class="main">The Infantes of Lara</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Few Spanish <i>romanceros</i> celebrate incidents more
tragic or memorable than those which cluster round the massacre of the
unfortunate Infantes or Princes of Lara by their treacherous uncle, Ruy
or Roderigo Vel&aacute;squez. Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly thinks that one of
these originated from a lost epic written between 1268 and 1344,
&ldquo;or perhaps from a lost recast of this lost epic.&rdquo; Strange
that such epics should <i>all</i> be lost! He pleads that Lockhart
might have utilized other more &lsquo;energetic&rsquo; ballads to
illustrate this legend, but I think in this does some despite to the
very fine and spirited translation entitled &ldquo;The Vengeance of
Mudara&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Oh, in vain have I slaughter&rsquo;d the Infants of
Lara;</p>
<p class="line">There&rsquo;s an heir in his halls&mdash;there&rsquo;s

<p class="line">There&rsquo;s the son of the renegade&mdash;spawn of
Mahoun:</p>
<p class="line">If I meet with Mudara, my spear brings him down.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">As I read these lines I recall a big drawing-room, the
narrow casements of which look upon a wilderness of garden woodland
made magical by the yellow shadows of the hour when it is neither
evening nor afternoon. Upon a table of mottled rosewood lies a copy of
the <i>Spanish Ballads</i> in the embossed and fretted binding of the
days when such books were given as presents and intended for
exhibition. A child of ten, I had stolen into this Elysium redolent of
rose-leaves and potpourri, and, opening the book at random, came upon
the lines just quoted. For the first time I tasted the delights of
rhythm, of music in words. The verses photographed themselves on my
brain. Searching through the book until darkness fell, it seemed to me
that I could find nothing so good, nothing that swung along with such a
gallop. But the cup had been held to my lips, and my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>days
and nights became a quest for words wedded to music. I had to look for
some time before I encountered anything better than, or equal to, the
haunting rhythm of &ldquo;The Vengeance of Mudara.&rdquo; The years
have brought discoveries beside which the first pales into
insignificance, adventures in books of a spirit more subtle, carrying
the thrill of a keener amazement; but none came with the force of such
revelation as was vouchsafed by that page in an unforgotten book in an
unforgettable room.</p>
<p>The first of the ballads in which Lockhart deals with the subject of
the Infantes of Lara&mdash;for the one we have been discussing follows
it&mdash;is entitled &ldquo;The Seven Heads,&rdquo; and details the
circumstance of the massacre of the unhappy princes. From the <i lang=
"es">Historia de Espa&ntilde;a</i> of Juan de Marinia (1537&ndash;1624)
we learn that in the year 986 Ruy Vel&aacute;squez, lord of Villaren,
celebrated his marriage with Donna Lombra, a lady of high birth, at
Burgos. The festivities were on a scale of great splendour, and among
the guests were Gustio Gonz&aacute;lez, lord of Salas of Lara, and his
seven sons. These young men, of the blood of the Counts of Castile,
were celebrated for their chivalric prowess, and had all been knighted
on the self-same day.</p>
<p>As evil chance would have it, a quarrel arose between
Gonz&aacute;lez, the youngest of the seven brothers, and one Alvar
Sanchez, a relation of the bride. Donna Lombra thought herself
insulted, and in order to avenge herself, when the young knights rode
in her train as she took her way to her lord&rsquo;s castle, she
ordered one of her slaves to throw at Gonz&aacute;lez a wild cucumber
soaked in blood, &ldquo;a heavy insult and outrage, according to the
then existing customs and opinions of Spain.&rdquo; What this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>recondite insult signified does not matter. But
surely, whatever its meaning, and making all allowance for the rudeness
of the age of which she was an ornament, the lady did greater despite
to herself than to her enemy by the perpetration of such an act of
crude vulgarity. The slave, having done as he was bid, fled for
protection to his mistress&rsquo;s side. But that availed him nothing,
for the outraged Infantes slew him &ldquo;within the very folds of her
garment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruy Vel&aacute;squez, burning with Latin anger at what he deemed an
insult to his bride, and therefore to himself, was determined upon a
dreadful vengeance. But he studiously concealed his intention from the
young noblemen, and behaved to them as if nothing of moment had
occurred. Some time after these events he sent Gustio Gonz&aacute;lez,
the father of the seven young champions, on a mission to Cordova, the
ostensible object of which was to receive on his behalf a tribute of
money from the Moorish king of that city. He made Gustio the bearer of
a letter in Arabic, which he could not read, the purport of which was a
request to the Saracen chieftain to have him executed. But the infidel
displayed more humanity than the Christian, and contented himself with
imprisoning the unsuspecting envoy.</p>
<p>In furtherance of his plans Vel&aacute;squez pretended to make an
incursion into the Moorish country, in which he was accompanied by the
Infantes of Lara with two hundred of their followers. With fiendish
ingenuity he succeeded in leading them into an ambuscade. Surrounded on
all sides by the Saracen host, they resolved to sell their lives at the
highest possible price rather than surrender. Back to back they stood,
taking a terrible toll of Moorish lives, and one by one they fell,
slain but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>unconquered. Their heads were dispatched to
Vel&aacute;squez as an earnest of a neighbourly deed by the Moorish
king, and were paraded before him and in front of their stricken
father, who had been released in order that Vel&aacute;squez might
gloat over his grief. When he had satisfied his vengeance the lord of
Villaren permitted the stricken father to return to his empty home.</p>
<p>But Ruy Vel&aacute;squez was not destined to go unpunished. While
Gustio Gonz&aacute;lez had been imprisoned in the dungeons of the
Moorish King of Cordova he had contracted an alliance with that
monarch&rsquo;s sister, by whom he had a son, Mudarra. When this young
man had attained the age of fourteen years his mother prevailed upon
him to go in search of his father, and when he had found his now aged
parent he learned of the act of treachery by which his brothers had
been slain. Determined to avenge the cowardly deed, he bided his time,
and, encountering Ruy Vel&aacute;squez when on a hunting expedition,
slew him out of hand. Gathering around him a band of resolute men, he
attacked the castle of Villaren, and executed a fearful vengeance upon
the haughty Donna Lombra, whom he stoned and burnt at the stake. In
course of time he was adopted by his father&rsquo;s wife, Donna Sancha,
who acknowledged him as heir to the estates of his father.</p>
<p>We have already indicated the stirring nature of the ballad in which
Mudarra takes vengeance upon the slayers of his brethren. Its
predecessor in Lockhart&rsquo;s collection, that in which the agonized
father beholds the seven heads of his murdered sons, falls far short of
it in power.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Wedding of the Lady Theresa&rdquo; is a
semi-historical ballad which tells of the forced alliance of a
Christian maiden to a noble worshipper of Mahoun. Alfonso, King of
Leon, desirous of strengthening his alliance with the infidel, intended
to sacrifice his sister, Donna Theresa, to his political necessities.
He paved the way for this betrayal by pretending that Abdalla, King of
the Moors, had become a Christian, and by indicating to her the
benefits of a union with the pagan prince. Totally deceived by these
representations, the lady consented to the match, was taken to Toledo,
and wed to the Moor with much splendour. But on the day of the marriage
she learned of her brother&rsquo;s perfidy, and when she found herself
alone with the Moorish lord she repulsed him, telling him that she
would never be a wife to him in aught but name until he and his people
embraced the Christian faith. But Abdalla ridiculed her scruples, and
took advantage of her unprotected state. As she had prophesied, a
scourge fell upon him as the consequence of his wicked act. Terrified,
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>sent Theresa back to her brother, with an
abundance of treasure, and she entered the monastery of St Pelagius, in

devotions.</p>

<p class="line">At length she for her fate prepares, a victim sad and

<p class="first">This ballad is no earlier than the sixteenth century,
and seems to be based upon historic fact, and, as Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly
points out, it confuses Almanzor and the Toledan governor Abdalla on
the one hand and Alfonso V of Leon with his father, Bermudo II, on the
other, and introduces chronological difficulties.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly dismisses in a word,
although it seems to me to merit some attention. De Vargas
distinguished himself greatly at the siege of Seville in the year 1248.
One day, while riding by the banks of the river, accompanied only by a
single companion, he was attacked by a party of seven mounted Moors.
His comrade rode off, but P&eacute;rez, closing his visor, and setting
his lance in rest, faced the paynim warriors. They, seeing who awaited
them, made all speed back to their own lines. As he made his way back
to camp P&eacute;rez noticed that he had dropped his scarf, and
immediately returned to seek for it. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>although he rode far
into the danger zone ere he found it, the Moors still avoided him, and
he returned to the Spanish camp in safety. The ballad makes
P&eacute;rez recover the scarf from the Moors, who had found it and
&ldquo;looped it on a spear.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">We come now to those ballads which recount the vivid
but sanguinary history of Don Pedro the Cruel. Many attempts have been
made to prove that Pedro was by no means such an inhuman monster as the
balladeers would have us believe. But probability seems to be on the
side of the singers rather than on that of the modern historians, who
have done their best to remove the stain of his ferocious acts from
Pedro&rsquo;s abhorred name. His first act of atrocity was that
celebrated in the ballad entitled &ldquo;The Master of St Iago,&rdquo;
which refers to his illegitimate brother. On the death of that
nobleman, his father, well aware of Pedro&rsquo;s vindictive
temperament, fled to the city of Coimbra, in Portugal. But, believing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=

intention of offering him violence, he accepted his invitation to the
Court of Seville, where a gallant tournament was about to be held. No
sooner had he arrived, however, than he was secretly put to death
(1358), it is believed at the instance of the notorious Maria de

</div>
<p class="first">The ballad recounts how Pedro, relenting somewhat,
imprisoned the false Maria de Padilla, but there is no evidence that
she either suggested the crime or suffered for it. Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly
gives it as his opinion that the dramatic power of the romance is
undeniable. Had he spoken of its melodramatic power I might feel
inclined to agree with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Pedro was accessory to the violent death of the young
and innocent princess whom he had married, and immediately afterward
deserted for ever, there can be no doubt,&rdquo; says Lockhart,
referring to the marriage of Pedro with Blanche de Bourbon. But whether
he murdered his queen or not, his paramour, Maria de Padilla, was
innocent of all complicity in the affair, although the ballad makes her
the instigator of the horrid deed, and it is plain that the poems which
refer to her were written with a sinister political motive.</p>
<p>Mariana, who is sufficiently reliable, states that Pedro&rsquo;s
conduct toward his queen had aroused the anger of many of his nobles,
who presented him with a remonstrance <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>in writing. His
fierce and homicidal temper aroused to fury at what he considered an
unwarranted interference in his private concerns, he immediately gave
the order that his unfortunate French consort should be put to death by
poison in the prison where she, was confined. The poem makes Pedro and
his paramour plot upon the death of the unhappy Queen in the crude
manner of the balladeer all the world over.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Maria de Padilla, be not thus of dismal
mood,</p>
<p class="line">For if I twice have wedded me, it all was for thy
good,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">may be good ballad-writing, but I confess the
barbarous inversion in the second line appears to me to be
unnecessary.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;But if upon Queen Blanche ye will that I some

Blanche&rsquo;s blood the ground,</p>
<p class="line">Such pennon shall they weave for thee, such sacrifice
be found.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">With the example of many enchanted passages of
allusion no less recondite occurring in the ballads of his own
country-side, Lockhart might reasonably have been expected to have done
much better than the last couplet.</p>

<p class="first">But I question if folk-poetry ever captured a lilt
more exquisite than that of the first four lines of &ldquo;The
Gardener&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240"
name="pb240">240</a>]</span>or a sharper note of anguish than that of
the last quatrain.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e4703src" href=
"#xd19e4703" name="xd19e4703src">3</a> To me at least Old Scots must
always remain the language of the ballad <i>par excellence</i>, by
virtue of the subtlety, the finely wrought and divinely coloured wealth
of expressive idiom which bursts from its treasure-chest in a profusion
of begemmed and enamelled richness, more various, more magical than any
Spanish gold. Much of this Lockhart filched to give his Castilian
bullion a replating. But in places he falls back most wretchedly upon
the poetical trickeries of his day, falls to the level of Rogers and
Southey, to the miserable devices and tinsel beggary of those bravely
bound annuals beloved by the dames and damsels of the day before
yesterday. In places, however, he outballads the ballad in pure
<i>gaucherie</i>.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">These words she spake, then down she knelt, and took

<p class="line">Her tender neck was cut in twain, and out her blood did

</div>
<p class="first">The next, and not the last of the series, as Mr
Fitzmaurice Kelly has it, is obviously the handiwork of Walter Scott,
than whom none could fail more miserably on occasion. We can picture
him doling &ldquo;The Death of Don Pedro&rdquo; from out the great
thesaurus of his brain (that sadly drained mint, ever at the service of
a friend or a publisher), as a dinted and defaced coin. Only in the
last verse does the old fire blaze up.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Thus with mortal gasp and quiver,</p>
<p class="line">While the blood in bubbles well&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="line">Fled the fiercest soul that ever</p>
<p class="line">In a Christian bosom dwell&rsquo;d.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">On such a subject the composer of &ldquo;Bonnie
Dundee&rdquo; might well have felt the blood run faster, and the pen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>quiver in his fingers like an arrow on a
tightened bow-string. Two royal brothers strive with hateful poniards
for each other&rsquo;s lives. Pedro, a prisoner in the hands of Henry
of Trastamara, his natural brother, is wantonly insulted by the
victorious noble, and replies by flying at his throat in an outburst of
animal courage and kingly rage. Dumbfounded at the death-struggle of
monarch and usurper, Henry&rsquo;s allies look on, among them the great
Du Guesclin. Pedro pins the lord of Trastamara to the ground. His
dagger flashes upward. Du Guesclin turns to Henry&rsquo;s squire.
&ldquo;Will ye let your lord die thus, you who eat his bread?&rdquo; he
scoffs. The esquire throws himself upon Pedro, clings to his arms and
turns him over, and, thus aided, Henry rises, searches for a joint in
the King&rsquo;s armour, and thrusts his dagger deep into that
merciless heart. The murderer, the friend of Jew and Saracen, is slain.
His head is hacked off, and his proud body trampled beneath mailed
feet. Surely a subject for a picture painted in the lights of armour
and the red shadows of blood and hate.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">They had better have let the ballad alone, those two
at Abbotsford. It does not seem to me &ldquo;a very striking
ballad,&rdquo; as Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly observes, but in its Castilian
dress it is sufficiently dramatic and exciting. <span class=

<p class="first">So run the first two verses, which I leave the reader
to translate for himself, lest further damage be done them.</p>
<p>The proclamation of Don Henry takes up the story where the preceding
ballad left it off. In the translation of this, it seems to me,
Lockhart has been much more successful than his great father-in-law
proved himself in that of its companion ballad. I do not think it
possible, however, to render adequately by an English pen the dignified
rhythm of the Castilian in which this <i>romancero</i> is dressed. But
the second verse,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">So dark and sullen is the glare of Pedro&rsquo;s
lifeless eyes,</p>
<p class="line">Still half he fears what slumbers there to vengeance
may arise.</p>
<p class="line">So stands the brother, on his brow the mark of blood is
seen,</p>
<p class="line">Yet had he not been Pedro&rsquo;s Cain, his Cain had
Pedro been,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">is really fine, expressive, and ascends a whole scale
of terrible thought and realization. Are these awful eyes dead? Can the
threat they hold be imaginary? My hands are wet with brother&rsquo;s
blood, but it is only by virtue of a slender chance that his are not
imbrued with mine. The verse is horribly eloquent of the death-cold
atmosphere of the moment which follows murder&mdash;simple, appalling,
desperately tragic. The mad grief of the slain King&rsquo;s paramour is
drawn with a touch almost as successful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 id="xd19e4803" class="main">The Moor Reduan</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We may pass by &ldquo;The Lord of Butrayo&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The King of Arragon&rdquo; and come to the ballad of &ldquo;The
Moor Reduan,&rdquo; a piece based on the siege of Granada, last
stronghold of the Moors, and the first of those in which Lockhart deals
with the <i>romanceros fronterizos</i>, or romances of the frontier,
which, as we have before remarked, may have been influenced by Moorish
ideas, or may even represent borrowings or <i>donn&eacute;es</i> of a
kind more or less direct. In his <i>critique</i> of this
<i>romancero</i> Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly says: &ldquo;Lockhart is, of
course, not to blame for translating the ballad precisely as he found
it in the text before him. Any translator would be bound to do the same
to-day if he attempted a new rendering of the poem; but he would
doubtless think it advisable to state in a note the result of the
critical analysis which had scarcely been begun when Lockhart wrote. It
now seems fairly certain that P&eacute;rez de Hita ran two
<i>romanceros</i> into one, and that the verses from the fourth stanza
onward in Lockhart,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They passed the Elvira gate with banners all
displayed,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">are part of a ballad on Boabdil&rsquo;s expedition
against Lucena in 1483.&rdquo; This is only partially correct. Lockhart
knew perfectly well that the piece was not homogeneous. Indeed he says,
&ldquo;The following is a version of certain parts of <i>two
ballads</i>,&rdquo; although he seems to have been unaware that one of
them was that dealing with Boabdil&rsquo;s expedition. That portion,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>indeed, provides by far the best elements in the
composition.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">What caftans blue and scarlet, what turbans
pleach&rsquo;d of green;</p>
<p class="line">What waving of their crescents, and plumages
between;</p>
<p class="line">What buskins and what stirrups, what rowels chased in
gold,</p>
<p class="line">What handsome gentlemen, what buoyant hearts and
bold!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Reduan had registered a rash vow to take the city of
Jaen so that he might win the daughter of the Moorish king. The ninth
verse is full of a grateful music, not too often found in the poetry of
the Britain of 1823:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">But since in hasty cheer I did my promise plight,</p>
<p class="line">(What well might cost a year) to win thee in a
night,</p>
<p class="line">The pledge demands the paying, I would my soldiers
brave</p>
<p class="line">Were half as sure of Jaen as I am of my grave;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">although, I confess, the internal rhyming of
&ldquo;paying&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jaen&rdquo; detracts from the melody of
the whole. And this is the besetting sin of Lockhart, that he mars his
happiest efforts by crudities which he evidently confounded with the
simplicity of the ballad form. In all British balladry, if memory
serves me, there is no such vulgarism as this. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this vivid verse, the first two lines of which seem
to me especially successful, Lockhart, with a stroke or two of his pen,
provides us with a moving sketch of the confusion and turmoil attending
the Moorish flight from Granada, the last stronghold of the Moors in
Spain, which fell to the victorious arms of Ferdinand and Isabella on
the 6th of January, 1492, the year of the discovery of America. The
remainder of the ballad is no better than Lorenzo de
Sep&uacute;lveda&rsquo;s rather unmusical original. It is pity that a
ballad beginning with such a spirited couplet should be lost in the
shallows and the miseries of such stuff as:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Unhappy King, whose craven soul can brook&rdquo;
(she &rsquo;gan reply)</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;To leave behind Granada&mdash;who hast not heart
to die&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Now for the love I bore thy youth thee gladly could I
slay,</p>
<p class="line">For what is life to leave when such a crown is cast
away?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here the spirit of the metre has deserted the body of
the verse, which is now merely galvanized into life by an artificial
current of pedantry. The striking inequalities in the work of Lockhart
are surely eloquent of the tragedy of the half-talent.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e4884" class="main">Don Alonzo de Aguilar</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Upon the fall of Granada the Catholic zeal of
Ferdinand and Isabella insisted upon the conversion of the Moors of
that province. Most of the defeated pagans <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>concurred, outwardly at least, with the royal
decree, but in the Sierra of Alpuxarra there remained a leaven of the
infidel blood who refused baptism at the hands of the priests who were
sent to seal them of the faith. A royal order at length went forth to
carry out the ceremony by force of arms. For a season the Moors
resisted with the stubborn courage of their race, but at length they
were subdued and almost extirpated. But their ruin was not accomplished
without severe losses on the side of their would-be proselytizers, one
of the most notable of whom was Don Alonzo de Aguilar, brother of that
Gonzalvo Hern&aacute;ndez de Cordova of Aguilar who gained widespread
renown as &lsquo;the Great Captain.&rsquo; But the ballad does not seem
to square with the facts of history. Indeed it places Aguilar&rsquo;s
death before the surrender of Granada, whereas in reality it took place
as late as 1501. Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly thinks that &ldquo;this points to
the conclusion that the romance was not written till long after the
event, when the exact details had been forgotten.&rdquo; But why blame
an entire people for what may have been a <i>lapsus memori&aelig;</i>
on the part of a single balladeer? On the other hand, Mr Kelly might
justly ask one to indicate <i>any</i> ballad springing from
folk-sources the details of which square with the circumstances as
known to history or ascertained by research.</p>
<p>Lockhart, as usual upon first mounting his destrier, dashes the
spurs in its sides with a flourish:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Fernando, King of Arragon, before Granada lies,</p>
<p class="line">With dukes and barons many a one, and champions of
emprise;</p>
<p class="line">With all the captains of Castile that serve his
lady&rsquo;s crown,</p>
<p class="line">He drives Boabdil from his gates, and plucks the
crescent down.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So far good. Now for the conclusion: <span class=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Moorish maidens, while she spoke, around her

dint of dart and arrow,</p>
<p class="line">And buried him near the waters clear of the bank of

purpose of showing how very freely those English authors who have
attempted to render verse from the Castilian have dealt with the
originals. And, as I have said before, I suspect that the principal
reason for this looseness is a lack of idiomatic grasp. Indeed, it is
obvious from most English translations that the sense of the original

<h3 id="xd19e5077" class="main">The Zegris&rsquo; Bride</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Zegris&rsquo; Bride&rdquo; tells in ballad
form of the fierce feud between the two Moorish parties in Granada, the
Zegris and the Abencerrages, the Montagues and Capulets of the last of
the Moorish strongholds, when factious strife certainly accelerated the
fall of their city. The ballad is well turned, and attractive in
rhythm:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Of all the blood of Zegri, the chief is Lisaro,</p>
<p class="line">To wield rejon like him is none, or javelin to
throw;</p>
<p class="line">From the place of his dominion, he ere the dawn doth
go,</p>
<p class="line">From Alcala de Henares, he rides in weeds of woe.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Such a phrase as &ldquo;the place of his
dominion&rdquo; is not suited to ballad composition, nor is the
four-line rhyming grateful to the ear, although the measure is all that
could be desired. Once more I think I see the hand of Scott in this
translation, his &lsquo;equestrian&rsquo; rhythm, his fondness for
introducing words intended to assist local colour, as</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Of gold-wrought robe or turban&mdash;nor jewelled
tahali,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">which he must, perforce, explain in a note as
&lsquo;scimitar.&rsquo; The young Zegri, we are told, is attired for
action, not for the cavalcade or procession. Indeed, his armour and
even his horse are camouflaged to assist his passage through an
enemy&rsquo;s country without observation. <span class=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The belt is black, the hilt is dim, but the sheathed
blade is bright;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">And again:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">In darkness and in swiftness rides every armed
knight,</p>
<p class="line">The foam on the rein ye may see it plain, but nothing
else is white.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Lisaro wears on his bonnet a sprig of bay given him by
Zayda, his lady.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">And ever as they rode, he looked upon his lady&rsquo;s
boon.</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;what fate may
be&mdash;I may be slaughtered soon.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But he lives to win his bride, as we are told in the
curt final verse:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Young Lisaro was musing so, when onwards on the
path</p>
<p class="line">He well could see them riding slow; then prick&rsquo;d
he in his wrath.</p>
<p class="line">The raging sire, the kinsmen of Zayda&rsquo;s hateful
house,</p>
<p class="line">Fought well that day, yet in the fray the Zegri won his
spouse.</p>

Oriental colouring:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Rise up, rise up, Xarifa, lay the golden cushion

flowing,</p>
<p class="line">And the lovely lute doth speak between the

<p class="line">Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the

</div>
<p class="first">Skilful weaving this. The lady would not look,
however, because Andella, who was about to wed another, had been false
to her. Ballad literature is scarcely a record of human constancy. In
Ballad-land the percentage of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252"

white, clown or knight, is a high one. Was the law regarding breach of
promise first formulated by a student of ballad lore, I wonder?
Whatever else it may have effected, it seems to have put an end to
ballad-writing, perhaps because it ended the conditions and
circumstances which went to the making of balladeering.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5156" class="main">Zara&rsquo;s Earrings</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The intriguing ballad of &ldquo;Zara&rsquo;s
Earrings&rdquo; bears upon it the stamp of natural folk-song. It may
come from a Moorish original, but appearances are often deceptive. In
any case it is worth quoting in part.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My earrings, my earrings, they&rsquo;ve dropt
into the well,</p>
<p class="line">And what to say to Mu&ccedil;a, I cannot, cannot
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Twas thus Granada&rsquo;s fountain by, spoke
Albuharez&rsquo; daughter.</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;The well is deep, far down they lie, beneath the
cold, blue water.</p>
<p class="line">To me did Mu&ccedil;a give them when he spake his sad
farewell,</p>
<p class="line">And what to say when he comes back, alas! I cannot
tell.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The lady resolves in the end to do the best thing she
can&mdash;that is, to tell the truth. There is a sequence of romances
about this Mu&ccedil;a, who seems to have been a Saracen of worth, and
the same must be remarked about Celin or Selim, his successor in the
collections of Lockhart and Depping. Had Lockhart been well advised, he
would have substituted the ringing and patriotic &ldquo;Las soberbias
torres mira,&rdquo; which is certainly difficult of translation, for
the very sombre &ldquo;Lamentation for the Death of Celin,&rdquo; fine
though it is. Anything in the nature of a ceremony or a procession
seems to have attracted him like a child. But let us have a verse of
the first poem. Even should we not know Spanish its music could not
fail to haunt and hold us. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href=

<h3 id="xd19e5198" class="main">Romantic Ballads</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now come to consider the romantic ballads, the
third and last section of Lockhart&rsquo;s collection. &ldquo;The Moor
Calaynos&rdquo; we have already described, and the same applies to
&ldquo;Gayferos&rdquo; and &ldquo;Melisendra,&rdquo; its sequel. The
ballad which follows these, &ldquo;Lady Alda&rsquo;s Dream,&rdquo; is
alluded to by Lockhart as &ldquo;one of the most admired of all the
Spanish ballads.&rdquo; It is no favourite of mine. I may judge it
wrongly, but it seems to me inferior, and I much prefer the stirring
&ldquo;Admiral Guarinos,&rdquo; which treads upon its halting heels
with all the impatience of a warlike rhythm to spur it on.</p>
<p>Guarinos was admiral to King Charlemagne. In my boyhood days the
condition of the British Navy was a newspaper topic of almost constant
recurrence, and I was wont to speculate upon the awful inefficiency
which must have crept into the Frankish fleet during the enforced
absence of its chief in the country of the Moors, for Guarinos was
captured by the Saracens at Roncesvalles. His captor, King Marlotes,
treated him in a princely manner, but pressed him to become a convert
to Islam, promising to give him his two daughters in marriage did he
consent to the proposal. But the Admiral was adamant and refused to be
bribed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>or coaxed into the acceptance of the faith of
Mohammed and Termagaunt. Working himself up into one of those passions
which seem to be the especial privilege of Oriental potentates,
Marlotes commanded that Guarinos should be incarcerated in the lowest
dungeon in his castle keep.</p>
<p>It was the Moorish custom to hale captives to the light of day three
times in every year for the popular edification and amusement. On one
of these occasions, the Feast of St John, the King raised a high target
beneath which the Moorish knights rode in an attempt to pierce it with
their spears. But so lofty was it that none of them might succeed in
the task, and the King, annoyed at their want of skill, refused to
permit the banquet to commence until the target was transfixed.
Guarinos boasted that he could accomplish the feat. The royal
permission was accorded him to try, and his grey charger and the armour
he had not worn for seven long years were brought to him.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They have girded on his shirt of mail, his cuisses well
they&rsquo;ve clasp&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="line">And they&rsquo;ve barred the helm on his visage pale,
and his hand the lance hath grasped,</p>
<p class="line">And they have caught the old grey horse, the horse he
loved of yore,</p>
<p class="line">And he stands pawing at the gate&mdash;caparisoned once
more.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Guarinos whispered in the old horse&rsquo;s ear, and
it recalled the voice of its master.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Oh! lightly did Guarinos vault into the
saddle-tree,</p>
<p class="line">And slowly riding down made halt before Marlotes&rsquo;
knee;</p>
<p class="line">Again the heathen laughed aloud&mdash;&ldquo;All hail,
sir knight,&rdquo; quoth he,</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Now do thy best, thou champion proud. Thy blood
I look to see.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">With that Guarinos, lance in rest, against the scoffer
rode,</p>
<p class="line">Pierced at one thrust his envious breast, and down his
turban trode.</p>
<p class="line">Now ride, now ride, Guarinos&mdash;nor lance nor rowel
spare&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Slay, slay, and gallop for thy life&mdash;the land of
France lies <i>there</i>!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">There would seem to be some connexion between this
ballad and the French romance of &ldquo;Ogier the Dane,&rdquo; and
Erman tells us that it was sung in Russian in Siberia as late as
1828.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lady of the Tree&rdquo; tells how a princess was stolen
by the fairies, and how a knight to whom she appealed for rescue turned
a deaf ear to her request and was afterward scorned by her when she
returned to her rightful station. &ldquo;The False Queen&rdquo; is a
mere fragment, but &ldquo;The Avenging Childe&rdquo; is both complete
and vivid. Mr Fitzmaurice Kelly declares that Gibson&rsquo;s version of
this ballad is superior to that of Lockhart. Let us compare a verse of
both.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Avoid that knife in battle strife, that weapon short
and thin;</p>
<p class="line">The dragon&rsquo;s gore hath bath&rsquo;d it
o&rsquo;er, seven times &rsquo;twas steeped therein;</p>
<p class="line">Seven times the smith hath proved its pith, it cuts a
coulter through&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">In France the blade was fashioned, from Spain the shaft
it drew.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Gibson renders this:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&rsquo;Tis a right good spear with a point so sharp,
the toughest plough-share might pierce.</p>
<p class="line">For seven times o&rsquo;er it was tempered fine in the
blood of a dragon fierce,</p>
<p class="line">And seven times o&rsquo;er it was whetted keen, till it
shone with a deadly glance,</p>
<p class="line">For its steel was wrought in the finest forge, in the
realm of mighty France.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">My preference is for Lockhart&rsquo;s rendering.
Gibson&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>first line is extraordinarily clumsy and
cacophonous, and the ugly inversions in the second line could scarcely
be tolerated outside the boundaries of the nursery. The remaining lines
are well enough, but no improvement, I think, upon those of Lockhart,
only the whole has a better swing, a livelier lilt, even if in the
first line this is roughened by the crudity occasioned by the
juxtaposition of so many sibilants and explosives. The Avenging Childe
duly accounts for his enemy.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Right soon that knife hath quenched his life&mdash;the
head is sundered sheer,</p>
<p class="line">Then gladsome smiled the Avenging Childe, and
fix&rsquo;d it on his spear.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Pity it is that a sense of humour seldom chimes with a
sense of the romantic. An &lsquo;avenging childe&rsquo; who could smile
gladly when fixing the head of a foe on his spear seems more fitted for
a Borstal institution than for the silken atmosphere of Courts. Yet he
married the Infanta, and was knighted and honoured by the King.
Possibly they found in him a kindred soul, if all we read in romance
regarding kings and infantas be true.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This very beautiful ballad, which is given in the

wandering by the seashore one morning, hears the mystic song of a
sailor in a passing galley.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Longfellow wrote a rather an&aelig;mic ballad,
&ldquo;The Seaside and the Fireside,&rdquo; on the Arnaldos episode,
incorporating several of the lines. Some years ago I published an
adaptation of it, altering the environment and changing the metre, and
this the reader may perhaps be complacent enough to accept as an
illustration of the manner in which &ldquo;this sort of thing is
done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">When the fleet ships stand inward to the shore</p>
<p class="line">As a white tempest, &rsquo;tis then I implore</p>

<p class="line">I know my evening vigil is in vain,</p>

<p class="line">Some splendid sea-spell in the sailor&rsquo;s soul,</p>
<p class="line">Swelling his heart, and bursting all control,</p>

<p class="line">Sang the strange colours of a distant south.</p>
<p class="line">Music deep-drowned within the siren sea</p>
<p class="line">Art thou beyond the call of ecstasy?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The &ldquo;Song for the Morning of the Day of St John
the Baptist&rdquo; has little to do with ballad, so we may pass it by,
as we may do the &ldquo;Julian&rdquo; fragment, one of the Gayferos
group. &ldquo;The Song of the Galley,&rdquo; which Mr Kelly regards as
&ldquo;too dulcet,&rdquo; seems to me poorly rendered:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Ye galleys fairly built,</p>
<p class="line">Like castles on the sea,</p>
<p class="line">Oh, great will be your guilt</p>
<p class="line">If ye bring him not to me!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This seems to me facility run mad, and great would be
my guilt did I quote more. To the very fine &ldquo;Wandering
Knight&rsquo;s Song&rdquo; I have already made allusion.
&ldquo;Minguillo&rdquo; enshrines a <i>motif</i> of almost world-wide
usage:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Since for kissing thee, Minguillo,</p>
<p class="line">My mother scolds me all the day,</p>
<p class="line">Let me have it quickly, darling;</p>
<p class="line">Give me back my kiss, I pray.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A conceit current from Caithness to Capo
d&rsquo;Istria. &ldquo;Serenade,&rdquo; from the <i>Romancero
General</i> of 1604, is certainly not peasant work. For his translation
of this Lockhart deserves high praise. Its music is reminiscent of
Shelley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Skylark,&rdquo; though of course it lacks the
almost intolerable keenness of that song most magical. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line xd19e1382">Nor chase from Zara&rsquo;s side</p>
<p class="line">Dreams bright and pure as these.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is inspired by a chaste and natural music all its
own, beyond the conscious artistry of the material man. To do Lockhart
justice, he loved the art of letters for itself alone. His was that
natural modesty which is content to sing in the shadow; nor can one
recall the memory of that fine and upright spirit, his labour and his
sacrifice, without praise and gratitude gladly bestowed. In this poem I
seem to see the real Lockhart&mdash;a man with the heart of a
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minguela&rsquo;s Chiding&rdquo; tells of the woe of a rustic
maid who loved to her destruction. &ldquo;The Captive Knight and the
Blackbird&rdquo; is the prison plaint of a warrior who knows not how
the seasons pass, or the moons wax and wane:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Woe dwells with me in spite of thee, thou gladsome
month of May;</p>
<p class="line">I cannot see what stars there be, I know not night from
day.</p>
<p class="line">There <i>was</i> a bird whose voice I heard, oh, sweet
my small bird sung,</p>
<p class="line">I heard its tune when night was gone, and up the
morning sprung.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Some cruel hand had slain the blackbird which was wont
to delight the poor prisoner&rsquo;s heart. But the King heard his
plaint while passing beneath his dungeon window, and set him free.</p>
<p>We may pass over the rather sepulchral &ldquo;Valladolid,&rdquo;
which tells of the visit of a knight to the tomb of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>his
lady-love in that city. &ldquo;The Ill-Married Lady&rdquo; recounts the
grief of a dame whose husband is faithless to her, and who consoles
herself with another cavalier. They are surprised by her lord, and she
artlessly asks: &ldquo;Must I, must I die to-day?&rdquo; and requests
to be buried in the orange garden. The romance does not tell us if her
last wishes were complied with, or even if her life was forfeited, but
to a Spanish public of the seventeenth century it was probably a
supererogation even to allude to such a sequel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dragut&rdquo; tells the story of a famous corsair whose ship
was sunk by a vessel belonging to the Knights of Malta. Dragut saved
himself by swimming ashore, but the Christian captives with whom his
barque was laden were all drowned save one, to whom the Maltese threw a
rope.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">It was a Spanish knight, who had long been in
Algiers,</p>
<p class="line">From ladies high descended and noble cavaliers,</p>
<p class="line">But forced for a season a false Moor&rsquo;s slave to
be,</p>
<p class="line">Upon the shore his gardener, and his galley-slave at
sea.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">We have already recounted the tale of the Count
Alarcos, and with it Lockhart&rsquo;s collection comes to an end.</p>
<p>But it is not in the pages of Lockhart alone that we should look for
good translations of the Spanish <i>romanceros</i>. John Bowring in his
<i>Ancient Poetry and Romances of Spain</i> (1824) has undoubtedly done
much to render some of the lesser lyrics of Castilian balladeers into
successful English verse. His translation of the celebrated
&ldquo;Fonte Frida&rdquo; is, perhaps, the best version of that
much-discussed poem to be met with in our language. It is clear that
Ticknor&rsquo;s rendition of this piece is practically a paraphrase of
Bowring&rsquo;s translation, of which I give the first two verses:

<p class="first">Ticknor speaks truly when he says of the Spanish
ballads: &ldquo;To feel their true value and power we must read large
numbers of them, and read them, too, in their native language; for
there is a winning freshness in the originals, as they lie embedded in
the old <i lang="es">romanceros</i>, that escapes in translations,
however free, or however strict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">romancero</i> entitled &ldquo;<span lang="es">Sale
la estrella de Venus</span>&rdquo; recounts a tragic story. A Moorish
warrior, flying from the city of Sidonia because of the cruelty of his
lady, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>who had taunted him with poverty and had
bestowed her hand upon another, makes the rocks and hills re-echo with
his plaints. He pronounces a terrible and bitter curse upon the proud
and wanton maiden who has spurned him. Maddened, he seeks the palace of
the Alcalde to whom his faithless fair one is to be espoused that
night. The building is bright with torches and gay with song.</p>

<p class="first">We have examined every type of Spanish ballad poetry.
The general note struck, we will observe, is a grave and romantic one,
the fruit of the thoughts of a proud and imaginative people. Nor can we
fail to notice the national note which rings through these poems, the
racial individuality which informs them. &ldquo;Poor Spain!&rdquo; How
often do we hear the expression employed by men of Anglo-Saxon race!
Let these undeceive themselves. What can material poverty signify to a
people dowered with such treasures of the imagination? Poor Spain! Nay,
opulent Spain; treasure-house of the minted coin of story, of the
priceless jewels of romance, of drama, and of song! <span class=

<h2 id="xd19e5569" class="main">Chapter XI: Moorish Romances of
Spain</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These are, of course, more of the nature of romances
<i>of</i> the Moors than <i>by</i> the Moors&mdash;tales embedded in
Spanish folk-lore relating to Saracen times and themes, rather than
written fictions existing in ancient Arab manuscripts. The Arab
literature of Spain was rather didactic, theological, and philosophical
than romantic. Fiction was, perhaps, the province of the itinerant
story-teller, as it still is in the East. But that many Moorish legends
and stories were handed down among the Spanish peasantry, especially in
the more southerly parts of the Peninsula, can hardly be doubted.
These, however, have been much neglected by compilers, and but few of
them are available. Such as exist in written form make up for their
scantiness in number by the qualities of wonder and beauty which inform
them. Perhaps no collection of the traditions of the Moors of Spain
equals that of Washington Irving in his <i>Tales of the Alhambra</i>.
These, he tells us, he &ldquo;diligently wrought into shape and form,
from various legendary scraps and hints picked up in the course of my
perambulations, in the same manner that an antiquary works out a
regular historical document from a few scattered letters of an almost
defaced inscription.&rdquo; The first of our Moorish legends,
therefore, I shall retell from the enchanted pages of the great
American wizard in words, apologizing to his shade for the alterations
in verbiage which I have been forced to make in view of the
requirements of modern readers. I have, indeed, entirely recast the
tale for twentieth-century use. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264"

<h3 id="xd19e5585" class="main">The Arabian Astrologer</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Aben Habuz, King of Granada, had in his old age earned
the right to repose. But the young and ardent princes whose territories
marched with his were in no mind that his old age should be free from
the alarms of war, and although he took every precaution to ensure his
possessions against the incursions of such hotheads, the constant
menace of an attack from one or other of them, no less than the unrest
which occasionally raised its head within his own dominions, filled his
declining years with irritation and anxiety.</p>
<p>Harassed and perplexed, he cast about him for an adviser capable of
assisting him to strengthen his position, but among the sages and
nobles of his Court he experienced such a cold selfishness and lack of
patriotic fervour as restrained him from adopting any of them as his
confidant in high affairs of state. While he meditated upon his
friendless condition it was announced to him that an Arabian sage had
arrived in Granada, whose fame as a man of wisdom and understanding was
proverbial throughout the East. The name of this pundit was Ibrahim Ebn
Abu Ajib, and it was whispered of him that he had existed since the
days of Mohammed, of one of whose personal friends he was the son. As a
child he had accompanied the army of Amru, the Prophet&rsquo;s general,
into Egypt, where he had remained for generations, employing his time
in the study of those occult sciences of which the Egyptian priests
were such consummate masters. Old as he was&mdash;and his appearance
was most venerable&mdash;he had walked the whole way from Egypt on
foot, aided only by a staff, on which were engraved hieroglyphs of deep
and hidden import. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>beard descended to his girdle, his
piercing eyes bespoke insight and intelligence almost superhuman, and
his bearing was more grave and majestic than that of the most reverend
<i>mullah</i> in Granada. It was said that he possessed the secret of
the elixir of life, but as he had attained this knowledge when already
well on in years, he had perforce to be content with his aged exterior,
although he had already succeeded in prolonging his existence for
upward of two hundred years.</p>
<p>King Aben Habuz, gratified at being able to extend his hospitality
to a visitor of such consequence, entertained him with marked
distinction. But the sage refused all his offers of soft living, and
established himself in a cave in the side of the hill on which the
famous palace of the Alhambra was later to be erected. This cavern he
caused to be altered in such a manner that it bore a resemblance to the
interiors of those lofty temples of the Egyptian land in which he had
passed so many years of his long life. Through the living rock which
formed its roof he commanded the Court architect to drive a deep shaft,
so that from the gloom of his cavernous abode he might be able to
behold the stars even at midday; for Ibrahim was pre-eminent in the
study of that lore of the heavenly bodies, that thrice noble science of
astrology, which the truly wise of all ages have recognized as the real
source of all divine knowledge, and the shallow erudition of a later
day foolishly despises. But only for a day in the round of eternity
shall that great and golden book be set aside; nor shall its pages,
arabesqued with mysterious and awful characters, ever be wholly closed
to man. The weird, serpentine script of this language of the sages
ornamented the walls of the astrologer&rsquo;s cavern, interspersed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>with the no less mystic symbols of ancient
Egypt, and, surrounded by these hieroglyphs and provided with the
primitive telescope we have described, the wise Ibrahim busied himself
in deciphering the history of events to come as written in the
glittering pages of the heavens.</p>
<p>It was only natural that the distressed Aben Habuz should avail
himself of the wisdom and foresight of the astrologer to the fullest
degree. Indeed, Ibrahim became indispensable to him, and was consulted
in every emergency. He responded graciously, and placed his marvellous
gifts entirely at the service of the harassed monarch. On one occasion
Aben Habuz complained bitterly of the constant vigilance he was forced
to maintain against the attacks of his restless neighbours. For a space
the astrologer was lost in thought. Then he replied: &ldquo;O King,
many years since I beheld a marvel in Egypt, wrought by a wise
priestess of that land. Above the city of Borsa towers a lofty
mountain, on which was placed the image of a ram, and above it the
figure of a cock, both cast in brazen effigy and turning upon a pivot.
Should the land be threatened by invasion the ram would turn in the
direction of the enemy and the cock would crow, and by this means the
inhabitants of Borsa were enabled to take timely measures for
defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that such a contrivance might be erected at
Granada,&rdquo; said the King fervently. &ldquo;Then might we rest in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astrologer smiled at the King&rsquo;s earnestness. &ldquo;I have
already told you, O King,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I have spent many
years in Egypt mastering the hidden knowledge of that mysterious land.
One day while seated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267"
name="pb267">267</a>]</span>on the banks of the Nile speaking with a
priest of that country, my companion pointed to the mighty pyramids
which cast their shadows on the place where we reclined. &lsquo;My
son,&rsquo; remarked the sage, &lsquo;thou beholdest these mountains in
stone, the memorials of kings who died while Greece was yet in the
cradle and Rome was unthought of; all the lore that we can teach thee
is as a drop of water to the ocean compared with the secrets contained
in those monuments. In the heart of the Great Pyramid is a
death-chamber where rests the mummy of the high priest who designed and
builded that stupendous pile. On his breast lies a wondrous book
containing magical secrets of great potency&mdash;that book, indeed,
which was given to Adam after the fall and by the aid of which Solomon
built the temple at Jerusalem.&rsquo; From the moment I heard those
words, O King, I might not rest. I resolved to find my way into the
Great Pyramid and possess myself of the magic volume. Collecting a
number of the soldiers of the victorious Amru and many of the native
Egyptians, I addressed myself to the task of piercing the solid masonry
which concealed this ineffable treasure, until, after unheard-of
labours, I came upon one of its hidden passages. Long time I searched
in the labyrinths of the vasty pyramid ere I arrived at the sepulchral
chamber. At length, groping in profound darkness, and haunted by the
rustling of the wrappings of mummied Pharaohs, I came upon the shrine
where the corpse of the high priest lay in grim state. I opened the
sarcophagus, and, unwrapping the voluminous bandages, found the mystic
tome lying among spices and amulets on the shrivelled breast. Seizing
it, I hastened through the black corridors, nor stayed until I beheld
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>the fierce Egyptian day and the friendly green
of the languid river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in what manner may all this assist me in my dilemma, O
son of Abu Ajib?&rdquo; asked the King querulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This have I told thee, O King, because by the aid of this
book most magical I can call to my assistance the spirits of earth and
air&mdash;jinns, and afreets, and peris&mdash;by whose help I shall
construct a talisman like that which surmounted the hill above
Borsa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astrologer was as good as his word. With all the resources of
the kingdom at his command, he built a great tower on the steeps of the
hill of Albayan. At his words of power spirits conveyed great stones
from the pyramids of Egypt, and of these the edifice was built. In the
summit of this tower he made a circular hall with windows looking
toward every point of the compass, and before each window he set a
table on which was arranged, as on a chessboard, a mimic army of horse
and foot, with the effigy of the potentate who ruled in that direction,
carved out of wood. Along with each table there was a small lance
engraved with magical characters. And this hall he closed with a gate
of brass, the key of which was kept by the King. Surmounting the tower
was a figure of a Moorish horseman cast in bronze and fixed on a
revolving pivot. He bore a shield and spear, the latter held
perpendicularly. This image looked toward the city, but when a foeman
approached it the horseman would face in his direction and would level
the lance as if about to charge.</p>
<p>Now, averse as Aben Habuz had been to war, he was all impatience to
test the virtues of this talisman. He had not long to wait, for one
morning he was informed that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>the face of the bronze horseman
was turned toward the mountains of Elvira, and that his lance was
directed against the pass of Lope. The trumpets were at once commanded
to sound the alarm, but Ibrahim requested the King not to disturb the
city nor call his troops together, but only to follow him to the secret
hall in the tower.</p>
<p>When they entered they found the window overlooking the pass of Lope
wide open. &ldquo;Now, O King,&rdquo; said the astrologer,
&ldquo;behold the mystery of the table.&rdquo; Aben Habuz looked at the
table covered with tiny effigies of horse- and foot-soldiers, and to
his astonishment saw that they were all in motion, that the warriors
brandished their weapons, and the steeds neighed, but these sounds were
no louder than the hum which rises from a beehive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the astrologer, &ldquo;if you
desire to cause panic and confusion among your enemies, you have only
to strike with the butt of the magic lance; but if you wish to bring
death and destruction among them, then strike with the
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aben Habuz, seizing the tiny lance, thrust it into some of the
figures, belabouring others with the butt. The former dropped upon the
board as dead, and the rest fell upon one another in confusion. Scouts
sent to confirm the destruction caused among the real invaders told how
a Christian army had advanced through the pass of Lope, but had turned
their weapons upon one another and had retreated across the border in
great confusion.</p>
<p>Delighted, the King requested Ibrahim to name his own reward.
&ldquo;My wants are few,&rdquo; replied the astrologer; &ldquo;if my
cave be fitted up as a suitable abode for a philosopher, I crave no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprised at his moderation, the King summoned his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>treasurer and commanded him to take a note of
the astrologer&rsquo;s requirements. The sage desired that an entire
suite of apartments should be hewn out of the solid rock, and this
having been done, he caused them to be furnished with the most lavish
magnificence. Princely ottomans and magnificent divans filled every
corner, and the damp walls were hung with the luxurious silks of
Damascus, while the rocky floors were carpeted with the glowing fabrics
of Ispahan. Seductive baths were constructed, and provided with every
kind of Oriental perfume. The apartments were hung with innumerable
silver and crystal lamps, which Ibrahim filled with a fragrant and
magical oil, which burned perpetually and could not be exhausted.</p>
<p>Amazed at the profligacy of the astrologer, the treasurer made
complaint of it to the King, but as his Majesty had passed his word to
the sage and had, indeed, invited his extravagance, he could not
interfere, and could only hope that the furnishing of the cavern would
soon come to an end. When at last the hermitage was replete with the
luxuries of three continents, the treasurer inquired of the astrologer
if he was satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only one small request more to make,&rdquo; replied
the sage. &ldquo;I desire that several dancing women be provided for my
amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The treasurer, rather scandalized, carried out the sage&rsquo;s
instructions, as he was bound to do, and Ibrahim, having all his wants
supplied, enclosed himself in his retreat. Meanwhile the King occupied
himself in the tower with mimic battles, and as the hand of the
astrologer was not there to moderate his warlike propensities, he
amused himself by scattering armies like chaff and smashing whole
battalions by a stroke of the magic lance. His <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>enemies, terrified at the fate of such
expeditions as approached his territory, ceased to trouble him, and for
many months the bronze horseman remained stationary. Robbed of his
amusement, Aben Habuz pined and grew peevish. But one glorious morning
news was brought him that the bronze cavalier had lowered his lance
toward the mountains of Guadix.</p>
<p>The King at once repaired to the tower, but the magic table placed
in the direction indicated by the horseman was placid. Not a mimic
warrior stirred, not a toy charger neighed. Perplexed, Aben Habuz
dispatched a scouting party, which returned after three days&rsquo;
absence to report that they had encountered no warlike array, nothing
more formidable, indeed, than a beauteous Christian damsel, whom they
had found sleeping by a fountain, and made captive.</p>
<p>Aben Habuz commanded that the damsel should be brought to him. Her
stately bearing and the lavish ornaments she wore bespoke her of
exalted station. In answer to the King, she explained that she was the
daughter of a Gothic prince, whose armies had been destroyed in the
mountains as if by magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware of this woman, O King,&rdquo; whispered the
astrologer, who stood by. &ldquo;Methinks she is a sorceress who has
been sent hither to work evil upon thee. Beware, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush, Ibrahim,&rdquo; replied Aben Habuz, &ldquo;thou art a
wise man enow, but little versed in the ways of women. Which of them,
pray, is not a sorceress? The damsel finds favour in mine
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O King,&rdquo; said Ibrahim, &ldquo;many victories have I
given thee, but of all the spoil thou hast won I have received nothing.
Give me then this Christian captive, who, I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>see,
carries a silver lyre, and who will make sweet music for me in my
retreat below ground. If she be a sorceress, as I suspect, I have
spells that will render her harmless. But as for thee, she will
speedily overcome thee if thou takest her into thy house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd19e5655width" id="p272"><img src="images/p272.jpg"
alt="Aben Habuz and the Captive Princess" width="490" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Aben Habuz and the Captive Princess</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the incensed monarch. &ldquo;By the beard
of the Prophet, thou art a strange hermit indeed! Know that this damsel
is not for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said the sage, in wavering tones. &ldquo;But
I fear for thee, royal Aben Habuz. Beware, I say to thee again,
beware!&rdquo; And the astrologer retired to his subterranean
abode.</p>
<p>Now Aben Habuz had fallen over head and ears in love with the fair
daughter of the Goths, and in his desire to please her strained the
resources of his kingdom to their utmost limits. He lavished upon her
all that was most exquisite and most magnificent in his storehouses and
treasuries. He devised for her pastime a hundred spectacles and
festivities, pageants, bull-fights, and tournaments. All these the
haughty beauty took quite as a matter of course. Indeed it almost
seemed as if she urged the infatuated monarch to greater extravagance
and more lavish expenditure. But no matter how profuse was his bounty,
she refused to listen to a single amorous word from the lips of Aben
Habuz, and whenever he essayed to speak his love she swept her fingers
across the strings of her silver lyre and smiled enigmatically. When
she acted thus the King invariably felt a drowsiness steal over his
senses, and as the dulcet sound gained ascendancy over him he would
sink into a sleep from which he usually awoke refreshed and
reinvigorated.</p>
<p>His subjects were, however, by no means so satisfied with this
condition of affairs as he was. Irritated by his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>profligate expenditure, and virtual enslavement
by a woman of hostile race, they at length broke into open revolt. But,
like Sardanapalus of Babylon, he roused himself from silken dalliance
and, putting himself at the head of his guards, crushed the outbreak
almost before it had come to a head. The episode disquieted him,
however, and he recalled the words of the wise Ibrahim, how that the
Gothic princess would bring him woe.</p>
<p>He sought the astrologer in his cavern, and requested his advice.
Ibrahim assured him that his position would be insecure so long as the
princess remained one of his household. To this Aben Habuz refused to
listen, and begged the sage to find him some retreat where he might
pass the remainder of his days in tranquillity along with the princess
of whom he was so deeply enamoured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my reward if I can procure thee such a retreat?&rdquo;
asked Ibrahim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thou shalt name thyself, O Ibrahim,&rdquo; replied the
infatuated old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast heard of the garden of Irem, O King, that jewel of
Arabia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, in fable. Dost thou mock me, astrologer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than these eyes have mocked me, O King, for I myself
have beheld that most delectable of all paradises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a youth I stumbled upon it when searching for my
father&rsquo;s camels. Once the country of the Addites, its capital was
founded by Sheddad, son of Ad, great-grandson of Noah, who determined
to build in it a palace surrounded by gardens that should rival
Paradise itself. But the curse of heaven fell upon him for his
presumption. He and his subjects were swept from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>earth, and his palace and gardens were laid
under an enchantment that hides them from human sight. When I had
recovered the book of Solomon I revisited the garden of Irem, and wrung
from the jinns who guard it the secret of the spells which render it
invisible to mortal sight. By virtue of these spells I can rear for
thee, O King, such a retreat even here on the mountain above thy
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O wise philosopher!&rdquo; cried Aben Habuz, &ldquo;ill was
it of me to doubt thee. Do as thou dost promise, and name thy
reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the reward I ask is the first beast of burden with its
load that shall enter the gate of thy paradise,&rdquo; said Ibrahim;
&ldquo;a moderate request, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moderate indeed!&rdquo; cried the King, transported by the
thought of joys to come, &ldquo;and I grant it immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astrologer at once set to work. On the summit of the hill above
his cavern he built a strong tower pierced by a great gateway, and on
the keystone of this portal he wrought the figure of a great key. The
gateway had also an outer guard, on which he engraved a gigantic hand.
Then on a night of unexampled darkness he ascended the hill and wrought
many incantations. In the morning he sought Aben Habuz and intimated
that his labours were at an end, and that the paradise which should be
invisible to all save him and his beloved awaited him.</p>
<p>On the following morning the King, accompanied by the princess,
ascended the hill, the latter riding on a white palfrey. Beside them
stalked the astrologer, assisted by his hieroglyph-covered staff. They
came to the arch, and the sage pointed out the mystic hand and key.
&ldquo;No mortal power can prevail against the lord <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>of
this paradise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until yonder hand shall seize
that key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the princess on her palfrey passed through the
portal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; cried the astrologer. &ldquo;Did we not agree
that the first animal with its burden which should pass through the
magic gateway should be mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aben Habuz smiled at first at what he regarded as a humorous sally
on the part of the sage; but when he discovered him to be in earnest he
waxed wroth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presumptuous astrologer!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Dare you
raise your thoughts to her whom I have chosen from among many
women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy royal word is pledged,&rdquo; replied Ibrahim. &ldquo;I
claim the princess in virtue of thine oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog of the desert!&rdquo; cried Aben Habuz. &ldquo;Thou shalt
feel the weight of my anger for this, juggler though thou
art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laugh at thee, Aben Habuz,&rdquo; cried Ibrahim derisively.
&ldquo;Mortal hand cannot harm me. Farewell. Remain in thy fool&rsquo;s
paradise and continue to reign over thy province. As for me, I go where
thou canst not follow me.&rdquo; And with these words he seized the
bridle of the palfrey, smote the earth with his magic staff, and sank
with the princess through the centre of the barbican. The earth closed
over them, and left not a trace of the aperture through which they had
disappeared.</p>
<p>When Aben Habuz recovered from his astonishment he ordered gangs of
workmen to be brought to the spot, and commanded them to dig. But the
earth seemed to fill in as fast as they threw it out. The opening of
the astrologer&rsquo;s cavern too had disappeared. Worse still, the
talismans by which the astrologer had secured <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>peace to Granada refused to work, and the old
unrest recommenced.</p>
<p>But one morning a peasant came before Aben Habuz and told him that
while wandering on the hill he had found a fissure in the rock through
which he had crept until he had looked down into a subterranean hall,
in which sat the astrologer on a magnificent divan, dozing, while the
princess played to him on her silver lyre. The distracted monarch
failed, however, to find the fissure. Nor could he enter the paradise
built by his rival. The summit of the hill appeared a naked waste, and
received the name of &lsquo;the Fool&rsquo;s Paradise.&rsquo; The
remainder of the wretched King&rsquo;s life was made a burden to him by
the inroads of his warlike neighbours.</p>
<p>Such is the story of the hill of the Alhambra, the palace on which
almost realizes the fabled delights of the garden of Irem. The
enchanted gateway still exists entire, and is now known as the Gate of
Justice. Under that gateway, it is said, the old astrologer remains in
his subterranean hall, lulled to constant slumber by the silver lyre of
the princess. They are, indeed, each other&rsquo;s captives, and will
remain so until the magic key shall be grasped by the magic hand and
the spell which lies upon this enchanted hill be dissolved.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The wonderful tale of <i>Cleomades and Claremond</i>
is almost certainly of Moorish origin in a secondary sense. In his
preface to Aden&egrave;s&rsquo; <i lang="fr">Berte aux grans
Pi&eacute;s</i> (Paris, 1832), M. Paulin Paris says: &ldquo;I am
strongly inclined to believe that the original of the fiction of
<i>Cleomades</i> is really Spanish or Moorish. All the personages are
Saracens or Spaniards; the scene is in Spain; the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>character of the fiction is akin to that of the
fictions of the East.&rdquo; Keightley believed that Blanche of
Castile, the wife of Louis VIII of France, had heard the tale in Spain,
and had narrated it to the French poet Aden&egrave;s, who cast it into
literary form.</p>
<p>Ectriva, Queen of Southern Spain, held a great tournament at
Seville, at which Marchabias, Prince of Sardinia, so distinguished
himself as to win her heart. She bestowed her hand upon the youthful
champion, and their union was a happy one, being blessed in time with
three daughters and a son. To the boy they gave the name of Cleomades,
while his sisters were called Melior, Soliadis, and Maxima.</p>
<p>Cleomades was dispatched upon his travels at an early age. But after
he had visited several foreign countries he was summoned home to be
present at the wedding of his sisters, who were about to be married to
three great princes, all of whom were famous as practitioners of the
magic art. They were Melicandus, King of Barbary; Bardagans, King of
Armenia; and Croppart, King of Hungary. The last-named monarch was so
unfortunate as to be a hunchback, and to his deformity he added a
bitter tongue and a wicked heart.</p>
<p>The three monarchs had encountered one another while still some
distance from Seville, and had agreed to give such presents to the King
and Queen as would necessitate a gift in return. Melicandus presented
the royal pair with the golden image of a man, holding in his right
hand a trumpet of the same metal, which he sounded if treason came near
him. Bardagans gave a hen and six chickens of gold, so skilfully made
that they picked up grain and seemed to be alive. Every third day the
hen laid an egg of pearl. Croppart gave a large wooden <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>horse magnificently caparisoned, which he told
his hosts could travel over land and sea at the rate of fifty leagues
an hour.</p>
<p>The King and Queen, generous to a fault, invited the strangers to
ask anything that it was in their power to bestow. Melicandus requested
the hand of the Princess Melior, Bardagans that of Soliadis, while
Croppart demanded that Maxima should be given him as a consort. The two
elder sisters were pleased with their suitors, who were both handsome
and amiable, but when Maxima beheld the hideous and deformed Croppart
she ran to her brother Cleomades and begged him to deliver her from
such an unsightly monster.</p>
<p>Cleomades represented to his father the wrong done by him in
consenting to such a match. But Croppart insisted that the King&rsquo;s
word had been passed and that he could not retire from his promise.
Cleomades, casting about for an argument, told the Hungarian king that
the value of the gifts of Melicandus and Bardagans had been proved, but
that, so far as any one knew, his story about the wooden horse might be
a mere fable. Croppart offered to test the capacity of his wooden
steed. At this the golden man blew his trumpet loudly, but all were so
interested in the proposed trial that no one noticed it. The prince
mounted the gaudily harnessed hobby, and at the request of Croppart
turned a pin of steel in its head, and was immediately carried into the
air with such velocity that in a few moments he was lost to sight.</p>
<p>The King and Queen, filled with indignation, had Croppart seized,
but he argued that the prince should have waited until he had shown him
how to manage the wooden horse. Meanwhile Cleomades sped onward
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>for miles and miles. His strange steed continued
to cleave the air at a terrific speed, and at length darkness fell
without any signs of its slackening its pace. All night Cleomades
continued to fly, and during the hours of gloom had plenty of time to
ponder upon his awkward situation. Recollecting that there were pins
upon the horse&rsquo;s shoulders like those upon its head, he resolved
to try their effect. He found that by turning one of them to right or
left the horse went in either direction, and that when the other was
turned the wooden hippogriff slackened speed and descended. Morning now
broke, and he saw that he was over a great city. By skilful
manipulation of his steed he managed to alight upon a lofty tower which
stood in the garden of a great palace.</p>
<p>Descending through a trap-door in the roof, he entered a gorgeous
sleeping apartment, and beheld a beautiful lady reclining on a
sumptuous couch. At his entrance she awoke, and cried out: &ldquo;Rash
man, how have you presumed to enter this apartment? Are you perchance
that King Liopatris to whom my father has affianced me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am that monarch,&rdquo; replied Cleomades. &ldquo;May I not
speak with you?&rdquo; he continued, for on beholding the princess he
had at once fallen violently in love with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Retire to the garden,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I will come
to you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince obeyed. In a few moments the princess joined him. But
they had not been long together when the lady&rsquo;s father, King
Cornuant of Tuscany, appeared, and at once denounced Cleomades as an
impostor, condemning him to death. The prince begged that he might
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>be permitted to meet his fate mounted upon his
wooden horse. To this the King assented, and the magical steed was
brought. Mounting it, he immediately turned the pin, and rose high in
the air, calling out to the princess, as he did so, that he would
remain faithful to her.</p>
<p>Shortly he arrived again in Seville, to the immense relief of his
parents. Croppart was requested to quit the country. But he had no mind
to do so, and in the guise of an Eastern physician remained in the
city. The two elder princesses were married to Melicandus and
Bardagans. As for Cleomades, he could not forget the beautiful Princess
Claremond, and, once more mounting his aery steed, he set off in the
direction of her father&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>On this occasion he had timed his visit so as to arrive by night at
the palace of his lady-love. Alighting in the garden, he made his way
to the chamber of Claremond, whom he found fast asleep. He awoke her
gently, and told her his name and station, avowed his love, and placed
himself at her mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the princess. &ldquo;Are you indeed
that Cleomades whom we regard as the very mirror of knighthood?&rdquo;
The prince assured her that such was the case, and taking from his arm
a splendid bracelet containing his mother&rsquo;s portrait and his own,
he presented her with it as an assurance that he spoke truly. The
princess confessed her love, and at his entreaty mounted behind him on
the magic horse. As they rose, Cleomades beheld the King in the gardens
beneath, surrounded by his courtiers. He called to him to fear nothing
for his daughter, and, setting the head of his mount toward Seville,
sped onward.</p>
<p>Alighting at a small rural palace some distance from the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>Court, Cleomades left the princess there to
recover from her journey, while he proceeded to acquaint his royal
parents with the result of his adventure. Claremond, having refreshed
herself, was walking in the garden for exercise, as she felt somewhat
stiff after her aerial voyage, when, as ill-luck would have it, she was
observed by Croppart, who, in the guise of an Indian physician, had
entered the garden, ostensibly to cull simples for medicinal purposes,
but in reality to spy out the land.</p>
<p>Croppart, seeing his own wooden horse, and hearing the princess
murmur the name of Cleomades, speedily formed a plan to carry the
damsel off. Approaching her, he offered to take her to Cleomades at
once on the back of the enchanted horse, and, fearing no evil, she
accepted his offer, and permitted herself to be placed on its back.
Croppart immediately turned the pin, and the horse ascended with
terrific velocity. At first Claremond was quite unsuspicious of the
designs of her abductor, but as time passed her fears were aroused,
and, looking down, she beheld, instead of populous cities, only gloomy
forests and deserted mountains. She begged Croppart to return with her
to the palace garden, but he merely laughed at her entreaties, and at
last, worn out with grief and disappointment, she swooned away.</p>
<p>Descending near a fountain, Croppart sprinkled the princess with its
water until she revived. Then he acquainted her with his intention to
make her Queen of Hungary. But the princess did not lack wit, and told
him that she was merely a slave-girl whom Cleomades had purchased from
her parents. This intelligence made the ferocious Croppart treat her
with even less respect than before, so that to save herself from his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>violence she consented to wed him at the first
city to which they might chance to come.</p>
<p>When he had wrung this promise from Claremond, Croppart, who
suffered greatly from thirst, drank deeply of the fountain. So icy cold
were its waters that on quaffing them he fell to the ground, almost
insensible. Claremond, overcome by fatigue and anxiety, fell fast
asleep. In this condition they were discovered by Mendulus, King of
Salerno, who at once conceived a strong attachment to the sleeping
damsel, and had her conveyed to his palace, where he lodged her in a
fair apartment. As for Croppart, so severe was the disorder which he
had contracted by drinking of the icy fountain that he expired shortly
afterward.</p>
<p>Claremond told King Mendulus that she was only a foundling whose
name was Trouv&eacute;e, and that she had accompanied Croppart, a
travelling physician, from one place to another, seeking a precarious
livelihood. This did not prevent him, however, from offering her his
hand and crown. To save herself from this new danger, Claremond had
recourse to feigned madness, and so convincingly did she play her part
that Mendulus had perforce to confine her under the charge of ten
chosen women, whose duty it was to restrain her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Court of Spain was thrown into the utmost confusion.
Cleomades, returning to the summer palace with his parents, could find
no trace of Claremond, and, overcome with grief, was brought back to
the capital in a state bordering upon frenzy. When he recovered he set
out for the kingdom of Tuscany in the hope that there he might obtain
tidings of his lady. Riding alone, he came to a castle, where he
encountered and overthrew two knights who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>refused to let him
pass. From them he learned that when a prince named Liopatris, who had
been betrothed to Claremond, arrived at the Court of Tuscany, three of
his knights had accused three of Claremond&rsquo;s maids of honour of
being accomplices in the abduction of their mistress. The knights whom
Cleomades had worsted were suitors for the hands of two of those
ladies, and had challenged their detractors, but as one of them had
been wounded by Cleomades, they could not now make good their
challenge. Cleomades graciously offered to take the place of the
wounded man, and with his unwounded comrade set out for the Court of
King Cornuant.</p>
<p>Next morning the combatants appeared in the lists. The three
accusers were overthrown, and the maids of honour pronounced innocent,
according to the laws of chivalry. Taking the damsels with them,
Cleomades and his new brother-in-arms returned to the castle whence
they had come, and when he had doffed his armour the prince-errant was
recognized by the ladies whom he had helped to rescue. Great was their
grief when they learned of the fate of Claremond. But one of them
begged Cleomades to seek the assistance of a famous astrologer who
dwelt at Salerno, &ldquo;who saw most secret things right clear.&rdquo;
Cleomades instantly resolved to go and consult this sage, and
accordingly next morning he set out for the city of Salerno, after
having taken an affectionate leave of the lovers.</p>
<p>Arrived at Salerno, Cleomades put up at an inn, and lost no time in
inquiring of the landlord where the astrologer might be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, sir!&rdquo; said the host, &ldquo;it is now a year
since he passed away. Never did we need him more. For had he been
alive, he might have served our King by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>restoring to reason
the most beautiful creature who ever lived.&rdquo; And he told
Cleomades the story of how Mendulus had found the hunchback and the
maid. At the mention of the wooden horse Cleomades started, but kept
his presence of mind, and assured the innkeeper that he possessed an
infallible cure for madness. He begged the man to lead him to the King,
and, on the plea that his arms might excite suspicion, donned a false
beard and the dress of a physician.</p>
<p>He was at once admitted to the royal presence, and on hearing of his
skill the King led him to the place where Claremond was confined.
Cleomades had taken with him a glove belonging to his lady-love, which
he had stuffed with herbs, and on the pretence that these would cure
her he placed it upon her cheek. Seeing her own glove, she regarded the
seeming physician earnestly, and succeeded in penetrating his disguise.
But, still feigning insanity, she begged that her wooden horse might be
brought, so that it could dispute with the learned doctor. It was
carried into the garden where they were, and the princess pretended to
have a whim that she could only be cured if she and the physician
mounted the wooden steed. To this Mendulus consented, and when they
bestrode the artificial hippogriff Cleomades turned the pin, and in a
moment they rose like an arrow from the bow.</p>
<p>Next morning the happy pair arrived in Seville. Their nuptials were
immediately performed, and Liopatris was consoled with Princess Maxima,
so that no one was left lamenting.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Legend tells us that when Mohammed el Haygari, or
&lsquo;the Left-handed,&rsquo; reigned in Granada he once encountered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>a train of horsemen riding back from a foray in
Christian lands. He observed in the ranks of their captives a beautiful
damsel richly attired, and learned that she was the daughter of the
commander of a frontier fortress which had been taken and sacked in the
course of the expedition. The lady was accompanied by a duenna, and
Mohammed ordered that both women should be conveyed to his harem.</p>
<p>Day by day he urged the captive damsel to become his queen. But his
faith as well as his age caused her family to reject his advances. In
his perplexity he resolved to enlist the good graces of her duenna, who
undertook to plead his cause with her young mistress. She told the lady
that she was foolish to pine in a beautiful palace, who had henceforth
been used only to a dull old frontier castle, and that by marrying
Mohammed she could make herself mistress of all she surveyed instead of
remaining a captive. At last her arguments prevailed. The Spanish lady
consented to unite herself to the Moorish monarch, and even outwardly
conformed to his religion, which the duenna also embraced with all the
fervour of a proselyte, being re-named Kadiga.</p>
<p>In course of time the Spanish lady presented her lord with three
daughters at a single birth. The Court astrologers cast the nativities
of the infants, and with many ominous warnings cautioned their father
to keep strict guard over them when they arrived at a marriageable
age.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward his queen died, and Mohammed, with the
astrologers&rsquo; warning ringing in his ears, resolved to shut the
princesses up in the royal castle of Salobre&ntilde;a, a place of great
strength, overlooking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=
"#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>the Mediterranean, where he felt
certain no harm could come to them.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Three Princesses watch the Approach of the
White-sailed Galley</p>
</div>
<p>Years passed and at length the princesses became of marriageable
age. Although they had been brought up by the discreet Kadiga with the
greatest care, and had always been together, their characters were of
course very different one from another. Zayda, the eldest, was of an
intrepid spirit, and took the lead in everything. Zorayda, the second,
had a strong sense of beauty, which probably accounted for the fact
that she spent a large portion of her time gazing in the glass, or in
the fountain which plashed and sang in the marble court of the castle.
Zorahayda, the youngest, was soft and timid, and given to reverie. All
three were surpassingly beautiful, and as she gazed upon them the
shrewd old Kadiga would shake her head and sigh. When they inquired of
her why she did so, she would turn the question aside with a laugh and
direct the conversation to a less dangerous topic.</p>
<p>One day the princesses were seated at a casement which commanded a
noble view of the heaven-blue Mediterranean, the dreamy waters of which
whispered musically to the palm-shadowed shores which skirted the
height upon which the towers of Salobre&ntilde;a stood. It was one of
those evenings on which we feel it difficult to believe that we are not
temporary sojourners in a land of vague deliciousness, where all is
beautiful as it is unreal. Mists dyed in the sunset rose like incense
from the urns of twilight, hiding the far distances of sea and sky.
From between the curtains of sea-shadows there drifted a white-sailed
galley, which glided toward the shore, where it anchored. A number of
Moorish soldiers landed on the beach, conducting several Christian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>prisoners, among whom were three Spanish
cavaliers richly dressed. These, though loaded with chains, carried
themselves in a lofty and distinguished manner, and the princesses
could not refrain from gazing upon them with intense and breathless
interest. Never before had they seen such noble-looking youths, who had
so far only beheld black slaves and the rude fishermen of the coast, so
small wonder was it that the sight of these brave cavaliers should
arouse commotion in their bosoms.</p>
<p>The princesses remained gazing until the prisoners were out of
sight. Then with long-drawn sighs they turned from the window and sat
down, musing and pensive, on their ottomans. The discreet Kadiga,
finding them thus, learned from them what they had seen, and in answer
to their inquiries regarding such beings related to them many a tale of
cavalier life in Christian Spain, which only served to heighten the
curiosity which the appearance of the captives had excited. But it did
not take the sage old woman long to discover the mischief she was
doing, and, full of fears for which she could scarcely account, she
dispatched a slave to her royal master, with the symbolic message of a
basket filled with leaves of the fig and vine, on which lay a peach, an
apricot, and a nectarine, all in the early stage of tempting ripeness,
which Mohammed, skilled in the Oriental language of fruits and flowers,
rightly interpreted as meaning that his daughters had arrived at
marriageable age.</p>
<p>Recalling the advice of the astrologers, he resolved to bring the
princesses under his immediate guardianship, and at once commanded that
a tower of the Alhambra should be prepared for their reception. He
himself set <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>out for Salobre&ntilde;a to conduct them
thither, and on beholding them, and perceiving how beautiful they were,
he felt glad that he had wasted no time in bringing them to Court. So
conscious was he of the danger that three such beauties would run that
he prepared for his return to Granada by sending heralds before him,
commanding every one to keep out of the road by which he was to pass,
on pain of death. Then, escorted by a troop of the most hideous black
horsemen he could find, he set forth on the journey to his capital.</p>
<p>As the cavalcade was approaching Granada it chanced to overtake a
small body of Moorish soldiers with a convoy of prisoners. It was too
late for the soldiers to retire, so they threw themselves on their
faces on the earth, ordering their captives to do likewise. Among the
prisoners were the three cavaliers whom the princesses had seen from
the window of the castle of Salobre&ntilde;a, and they, too proud to
obey the order to grovel before their pagan enemy, remained
standing.</p>
<p>The anger of the royal Mohammed was aroused by this flagrant
defiance of his orders, and, drawing his <span class="corr" id=
"xd19e5838" title="Source: scimetar">scimitar</span>, he was about to
decapitate the unfortunate captives, when the princesses gathered round
him and implored mercy for them. The captain of the guard, too, assured
him that they could not be injured without great scandal, on account of
their high rank, and described to the irate monarch the manner in which
these illustrious youths had been taken captive while fighting like
lions beneath the royal banner of Spain. Somewhat mollified by these
representations, Mohammed sheathed his weapon. &ldquo;I will spare
their lives,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but their rashness must meet with
fitting punishment. Let them be taken to the Vermilion Towers and put
to labour.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289"
name="pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the agitation of the moment the veils of the three princesses had
blown aside so that their radiant beauty was revealed. In those
romantic times to see was often to love at once, and the three noble
cavaliers fell sudden victims to the charms of the royal damsels who
pleaded so eloquently for their lives. Singularly enough, each of them
was enraptured with a separate beauty; but it would be as impertinent
as illogical to ask the reason of this sleight of cunning Dame Nature,
who in romance, perhaps, is represented as being more judicious than
she really is.</p>
<p>The royal cavalcade now pressed onward, and the captives were
conducted to their allotted prison in the Vermilion Towers. The
residence provided for the princesses was all that imagination could
ask and splendour devise. It was situated in a tower somewhat apart
from the main palace of the Alhambra, and on one side was cheered by
the prospect of a garden beautiful as the first step into paradise,
while on the other it overlooked a deep and umbrageous ravine that
separated the grounds of the Alhambra from those of the Generalife. But
to the beauties of this delightful place the princesses were blind.
They languished visibly, and by none was their indisposition remarked
so shrewdly as by old Kadiga, who guessed its cause without any great
difficulty. Taking pity upon their forlorn condition, she told them
that as she was passing the Vermilion Towers on the preceding evening
she heard the cavaliers singing after the day&rsquo;s labours to the
strains of a guitar, and at the request of the princesses she arranged
with their jailer that they should be set to work in the ravine,
beneath the windows of the damsels&rsquo; apartments.</p>
<p>The very next day the captives were given labour which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>necessitated their presence in the ravine.
During the noontide heat, while their guards were sleeping, they sang a
Spanish roundelay to the accompaniment of the guitar. The princesses
listened, and heard that it was a love ditty addressed to themselves.
The ladies replied to the sound of a lute played by Zorayda, the burden
of which was:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The rose by the screen of her leaves is concealed,</p>
<p class="line">But the song of the nightingale pierces the shield.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Every day the cavaliers worked in the ravine, and an
intercourse was maintained between them and the no less captive
princesses by songs and romances which breathed the feelings of either
party. In time the princesses showed themselves on the balcony when the
guards were wrapped in noonday slumber. But at length this desirable
condition of affairs was interrupted, for the three young nobles were
ransomed by their families and repaired to Granada to commence their
homeward journey. They approached the aged Kadiga, and requested her to
assist them to fly with the princesses to Spain. This proposal the old
dame communicated to her young mistresses, and finding that they
embraced it with alacrity a plan of escape was arranged. The rugged
hill on which the Alhambra is built was at that time tunnelled by many
a subterranean passage leading from the fortress to various parts of
the city, and Kadiga arranged to conduct the royal damsels by one of
these to a sally-port beyond the walls of Granada, where the cavaliers
were to be in waiting with swift horses to bear the whole party over
the borders.</p>
<p>The appointed night arrived, and when the Alhambra <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>was
buried in deep sleep the princesses, accompanied by their duenna,
descended from their apartments to the garden by means of a
rope-ladder&mdash;all save Zorahayda, the youngest and most timorous,
who at the decisive moment could not endure the idea of leaving her
father. The advance of the night patrol which guarded the palace made
it necessary for her sisters and Kadiga to fly without her. Groping
their way through the fearful labyrinth, they succeeded in reaching the
gate outside the walls. The Spanish cavaliers were waiting to receive
them. The lover of Zorahayda was frantic when he learned that she had
refused to leave the tower, but there was no time to waste in
lamentations; the two princesses mounted behind their lovers, Kadiga
behind another rider, and, dashing the spurs into the flanks of their
steeds, the party galloped off at top speed.</p>
<p>They had not proceeded far when they heard the noise of an alarm
from the battlements of the Alhambra, while a lurid watch-fire burst
into flame on its topmost turret. Lashing their horses to a frenzy of
speed, they succeeded in outdistancing their pursuers, and by taking
unfrequented paths and hiding in wild barrancas they were at last so
fortunate as to reach the city of Cordova, where the princesses were
received into the bosom of the Church and united to their respective
lovers.</p>
<p>Mohammed was well-nigh demented at the loss of his daughters, but,
rather unnecessarily, took pains to redouble his watch over the one who
had remained. The unfortunate Zorahayda, thus closely guarded, repented
of her vacillation, and we are told that many a night she was seen
leaning on the battlements of the tower in which she was confined,
looking in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>direction of Cordova. Legend, never very
merciful either to heroine or reader, says that she died young, and her
melancholy fate gave birth to many a sad ballad, both Moorish and
Castilian, so that she was at least successful in inspiring
song&mdash;a celebrity to which her more fortunate sisters did not
attain.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5868" class="main">The Story of Prince Ahmed</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once again the ancient city of Granada is the scene of
the legend we are about to relate. But, from considerations which we
will adduce later, there is good reason to believe the story to be of
Persian origin. It recounts the history of Prince Ahmed, surnamed
&lsquo;al Kamel,&rsquo; or &lsquo;the Perfect,&rsquo; because of the
beauty and equability of his temperament. At the birth of this prince
of happy disposition the Court astrologers predicted that his career
would be singularly fortunate, provided one difficulty could be
overcome; but that difficulty was sufficiently great to daunt the heart
of any monarch, so that we cannot be surprised when we learn that his
royal father grew pessimistic regarding his chances of happiness when
the wise men informed him that in order to circumvent a cruel fate his
son must be kept from the allurements of love until he attained the age
of manhood.</p>
<p>The perplexed King acted as most fathers in romances do&mdash;that
is, he confined his son from his earliest infancy in a delightfully
secluded palace which he built for the purpose on the brow of the hill
above the Alhambra. This building, which is now known as the
Generalife, is surrounded by lofty walls, and here the young prince
grew up under the care of Eben Bonabben, an Arabian sage of wisdom and
other formidable qualities, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293"
href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>made him a suitable guardian
for a budding royalty in such case as Ahmed.</p>
<p>Under the tuition of this grave preceptor the prince attained to his
twentieth year totally ignorant of the tender passion. About this time
a change came over his habitual docility, and instead of listening
attentively to the discourses of Eben Bonabben, he neglected his
studies and took to strolling in the gardens of his abode. His
instructor, who saw how it was with him, and that the latent tenderness
of his nature had awakened, redoubled his care, and shut him up in the
most remote tower of the Generalife. In order to interest him in
something that would remove his thoughts from speculations which might
prove dangerous, he instructed his pupil in the language of birds, and
the Prince, taking kindly to this recondite subject, soon mastered it
completely. After trying his skill upon a hawk, an owl, and a bat with
indifferent success, he listened to the chorus of birds in his garden.
It was spring-time, and each and every feathered songster was pouring
out his heart in an ecstasy of love, repeating the word again and yet
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo; cried the prince at length. &ldquo;What may this
love be?&rdquo; He inquired of Eben Bonabben, who at the question felt
his head roll ominously on his shoulders, as if in pledge of what would
happen to it did he not avert the question. He informed Ahmed that love
was one of the greatest evils which poor humanity has to endure; that
it made strife between friends and brethren, and had brought about the
ruin of some of the greatest of men. Then he departed in perturbation,
leaving the Prince to his own thoughts.</p>
<p>But Ahmed observed that the birds which sang so lustily <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>of
love were far from unhappy, and therefore doubted the arguments of his
preceptor. Next morning as he lay on his couch, lost in the pursuit of
the enigma which had presented itself to his thoughts, a dove, chased
by a hawk, flew through the casement and fluttered to the floor. The
Prince took up the terrified bird and smoothed its ruffled plumage. But
it seemed disconsolate, and on his asking for what it grieved, it
replied that its discontent was caused by separation from its mate,
whom it loved with all its heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, beautiful bird, what is this thing called love that
these birds in the garden sing of so constantly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; said the bird, &ldquo;is the great mystery and
principle of life. Every created being has its mate. Hast thou spent so
many of the precious days of youth without experiencing it? Has no
beautiful princess or lovely damsel ensnared thine heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince released the dove and sought out Bonabben.
&ldquo;Miscreant!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;why hast thou kept me in this
abject ignorance&mdash;why withheld from me the great mystery and
principle of life? Why am I alone debarred from the enjoyment of
love?</p>
<p>Bonabben saw that further subterfuge was useless, so he revealed to
his charge the predictions of the astrologers and the consequent
necessity for the precautions with which his youth had been surrounded.
He further assured the prince that did the King learn how his trust had
failed his head would pay forfeit. The Prince, horrified to learn this,
promised to conceal his knowledge, and this in some measure quieted the
fears of the philosopher.</p>
<p>Some days after this episode the Prince was reclining in the garden
when his friend the dove alighted fearlessly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>upon
his shoulder. He asked it whence it came, and it answered that it came
from a far land, where it had seen a beautiful princess, who, like
himself, had been enclosed within the high walls of a secret retreat
and kept in ignorance of the existence of love. The knowledge that a
being of the opposite sex existed who had been brought up in like
circumstances to himself acted like a spark of fire to the heart of
Ahmed. He at once wrote a letter couched in the most impassioned
language, which he addressed, &ldquo;To the unknown beauty, from the
captive Prince Ahmed,&rdquo; and this he entrusted to the dove, who
promised to convey it to the object of his adoration without a
moment&rsquo;s delay.</p>
<p>Day after day Ahmed watched for the return of the messenger of love,
but in vain. At last, one evening the bird fluttered into his
apartment, and falling at his feet expired. The arrow of some wanton
archer had pierced its breast, yet it had struggled on to the
fulfilment of its mission. Ahmed, picking up the little body, found it
encircled by a chain of pearls, attached to which was a small enamelled
picture representing a lovely princess in the flower of youth and
beauty. The prince pressed the picture to his lips in a fervour of
passion, and at once resolved upon flight, his object being to seek the
original of the portrait, whatever dangers and obstacles might lie in
the accomplishment of his purpose.</p>
<p>Seeking the advice of the wise owl, whom he had not spoken to since
he had been a beginner in the study of the language of birds, he
collected all his jewels, and on the same night lowered himself from
the balcony, clambered over the outer walls of the Generalife, and,
accompanied by the wise old bird, who had agreed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>act
as his cicerone, set out for Seville, his purpose being to seek a raven
whom the owl knew to be a great necromancer, who might assist him in
his quest. In time they arrived at the southern city, and sought the
high tower in which the raven dwelt. They found the gifted bird, and
were advised by it to go to Cordova and seek the palm-tree of the great
Abderahman, which stood in the courtyard of the principal mosque, at
the foot of which they would encounter a great traveller, who would
give them information regarding the object of their search.</p>
<p>Following the raven&rsquo;s instructions, they travelled to Seville,
and were annoyed to find at the foot of the tree in question an immense
crowd, listening attentively to the chattering of a parrot, whose
plumage was of the most brilliant green, and whose pragmatical eye held
much wisdom. When the crowd had departed, the prince consulted the bird
regarding his quest, and was amazed to hear it burst into cries of
discordant laughter when it gazed upon the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor youth,&rdquo; it cackled, &ldquo;are you another victim
of love? Know that this picture you worship so devoutly is that of the
Princess Aldegonda, daughter of the Christian King of
Toledo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me in this matter, good bird,&rdquo; cried the prince,
&ldquo;and I shall find you a distinguished place at Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said the parrot. &ldquo;All I ask
is that it be a sinecure, for we clever folk have a great dislike for
hard work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accompanied by the owl and the parrot, Ahmed proceeded upon his
journey to Toledo in search of the Princess Aldegonda. Their progress
through the stern passes of the Sierra Morena and across the
sun-drenched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>plains of La Mancha and Castile was slow, but at
long last they came in sight of Toledo, at the foot of whose steeps the
Tagus rushed in brawling cascades. The garrulous parrot at once pointed
out the abode of the Princess Aldegonda, a stately palace rising out of
the bowers of a delightful garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Toledo!&rdquo; cried the owl in ecstasy. &ldquo;Toledo,
thou city of magic and mystery! What spells, what enchantments of
ancient wizardry have not been recited among thy carven shadows! City
of learning, of strange miracles, of a thousand
profundities&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;City of a thousand fiddlesticks!&rdquo; piped the parrot.
&ldquo;A truce to your raptures, friend philosopher. O Toledo,&rdquo;
he apostrophized, with wings outspread in mimicry of the owl,
&ldquo;city of nuts and wine, of figs and oil, of banquets, jousts, and
enchanting se&ntilde;oritas! Now, my prince, shall I not fly to the
Princess Aldegonda and acquaint her with the fact of our
arrival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so, best of birds,&rdquo; replied the Prince
enthusiastically. &ldquo;Tell her that Ahmed, the pilgrim of love, has
come to Toledo in quest of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parrot immediately spread his wings and flew off on his mission.
He beheld the princess reclining on a couch, and, alighting, he
advanced with the air of a courtier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful princess,&rdquo; he said, with a low bow, &ldquo;I
come as ambassador from Prince Ahmed, of Granada, who has journeyed to
Toledo to bask in the light of thine eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O joyful news!&rdquo; cried the princess. &ldquo;I had begun
to doubt the constancy of Ahmed. Hie thee back to him as fast as thy
green wings will take thee, and tell him that his poetry has been the
food of my soul, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href=
"#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>his letters are engraven on my
heart. But, alas! he must prepare to prove his love by force of arms.
To-morrow is my seventeenth birthday, in honour of which the King my
father is to hold a great tournament, and my hand is to be the prize of
the victor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahmed was delighted with the news which the parrot brought him, but
his happiness at finding the princess had remained faithful was
shadowed by the knowledge that he would have to do battle for her; for
he had not been trained in the exercises of chivalry. In his dilemma he
turned to the wise owl, who, as usual, threw much light on the matter,
for he unfolded to him that in a neighbouring mountain there was a cave
where lay on an iron table a suit of magical armour and near it an
enchanted steed that had been shut up there for generations. After a
search the cavern was located. A lamp of everlasting oil shed a solemn
light among the profound shadows of the place, and by its gleam the
armour and the bespelled charger were soon found, as the owl had said.
Donning the mail, Ahmed leapt upon the destrier&rsquo;s back, and with
a loud neighing the steed awoke and bore him from the place, the owl
and the parrot flying one on either side of him.</p>
<p>Next morning Ahmed proceeded to the lists, which were situated in a
large plain near the city. They presented a scene of unparalleled
brilliance, and noble knights and lovely ladies had congregated in
hundreds to try their skill in arms or display their beauty. But all
the latter were quite eclipsed by the Princess Aldegonda, who shone
like the moon among the stars. At the appearance of Ahmed, who was
announced as &lsquo;The Pilgrim of Love,&rsquo; excitement ran high,
for he made a most gallant and resplendent figure in his glittering
armour and bejewelled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href=
"#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>casque. He was informed, however,
that none but princes might encounter in the tournament, and on
learning this he disclosed his rank and name. On hearing that he was a
Moslem a universal scoffing arose among the Christian champions, and
Ahmed, incensed, challenged the knight who displayed the bitterest
enmity. The course was run, and the brawny scoffer tilted out of his
saddle. But the prince now found that he had to deal with a demoniac
horse and armour. Once in action, nothing could control them. The
Arabian steed charged into the thickest of the throng. Down went
Ahmed&rsquo;s opponents before his levelled lance like ninepins, so
that the lists were soon strewn with their recumbent forms. But at
midday the spell which had been laid upon the charger resumed its
power. The Arabian steed scoured across the plain, leaped the barrier,
plunged into the Tagus, swam its raging current, and bore the prince,
breathless yet avenged, to the cavern, where it resumed its station
like a statue beside the iron table, on which the prince laid the
armour.</p>
<p>Ahmed&rsquo;s feelings were most unenviable, for among those whom he
had unhorsed in his wild career had been the King himself, the father
of Aldegonda, who, on witnessing the overthrow of his guests, had
angrily rushed to their assistance. Full of anxiety, he dispatched his
winged messengers to gather tidings. The parrot returned with a world
of gossip. Toledo, he said, was in consternation; the princess had been
carried home senseless, and the general opinion was that the prince was
either a Moorish magician or a demon such as tradition said dwelt in
the mountain caverns.</p>
<p>It was morning when the owl came back. He had peered through the
windows of the palace, and had seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>the princess kiss
Ahmed&rsquo;s letter, and give way to loud lamentations. Later, she was
conveyed to the highest tower in the palace, every avenue to which was
strictly guarded. But a melancholy, deep and devouring, had settled
upon her, and it was thought that she was the victim of magic, so that
at last a great reward&mdash;the richest jewel in the royal
treasury&mdash;was offered to anyone who should effect her cure.</p>
<p>Now the wise owl chanced to know that in the royal treasury was
deposited a certain box of sandal-wood secured by bands of steel, and
inscribed with mystic characters known only to the learned few. This
coffer contained the silken carpet of Solomon the Great, which had been
brought to Spain by exiled Jews. All this caused the prince to ponder
deeply. Next day he laid aside his rich attire, and arrayed himself in
the simple garb of an Arab of the desert, dyeing his face and hands a
tawny brown. Thus disguised, he repaired to the royal palace, and after
some delay, was admitted. When the King asked him his business, he
boldly claimed his ability to cure the princess, who, he said, was
certainly possessed of a devil, which he could exorcise by the power of
music alone, as the folk of his tribe were wont to do.</p>
<p>The King, seeing him so confident, immediately conducted him to the
lofty tower where the princess lay, the windows of which opened upon a
terrace commanding a view over the city and surrounding country. On
this terrace the prince seated himself, and began to play on his pipe.
But the princess remained insensible. Then, as if chanting an exorcism,
he repeated the verses of the letter which he had sent to the princess,
in which he had first declared his passion. Rousing, she recognized
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>the words with emotion, and asked that the
prince should be brought into her presence. Ahmed was conducted into
her chamber, but the lovers, knowing their danger, were discreet, and
contented themselves with the exchange of glances more eloquent than
speech. Never was triumph of music more complete. The roses returned to
the pale cheeks of the princess, and so delighted was the King that he
at once requested Ahmed to select the most precious jewel in his
treasury. The prince, feigning modesty, replied that he disdained
jewels, and desired only an old carpet enclosed in a sandal-wood
coffer, which had been handed down by the Moslems who once owned
Toledo. The box was immediately brought, and the carpet spread out on
the terrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This carpet,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;once belonged to
Solomon the Wise. It is worthy of being placed beneath the feet of
beauty. Let the Princess stand upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King motioned his daughter to accede to the Arab&rsquo;s
request, and she at once complied. Then Ahmed took his place beside
her, and, turning to her astonished father, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know, O King, that your daughter and I have long loved one
another. Behold in me the Pilgrim of Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely spoken when the carpet rose in the air, and, to the
consternation of all, the lovers were borne off, and swiftly
disappeared.</p>
<p>The magical carpet descended at Granada, where Ahmed and the
princess were espoused to one another with fitting splendour. In course
of time he reigned in his father&rsquo;s stead long and happily. But
although he had become a king he did not forget the services of his
bird friends. He appointed the owl his vizier, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>parrot his master of ceremonies, and we may be
sure by these tokens that in all his royal and domestic circumstances
he was attended by wisdom and magnificence.</p>
<p>This striking tale is, of course, manufactured out of a number of
original and separate elements&mdash;the lovers destined to be kept in
ignorance of love because of some danger prophesied at their birth, the
old theme of the language of birds, the &lsquo;helpful animal&rsquo;
theme, and that of the magic carpet. The latter is merely an adaptation
of the idea that a magician was able to transport himself through the
air in a non-natural manner, and this ability he seems to have handed
on to the witches of the Middle Ages, whose broomsticks were merely
magical substitutes for the &lsquo;flying horse.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd19e5963src" href="#xd19e5963" name="xd19e5963src">1</a>
But the appearance of the carpet in such a tale makes it probable that
it drew its inspiration from Persia, the land where carpets were first
manufactured, as the wizards of more primitive folk adopted other and
simpler means of supernatural flight.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e5967" class="main">The Paynim&rsquo;s Promise</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A singular story which shows that tolerance and even
generosity were occasionally to be found between Moor and Christian in
ancient Spain is narrated in connexion with the exploits of Narvaez,
the general who commanded the garrison of Medina Antequara, a Moorish
town that had fallen into the hands of the Spaniards. Narvaez
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>made the city a centre from which he launched a
series of incursions into the neighbouring districts of Granada for the
purpose of obtaining provisions and relieving the unfortunate
inhabitants of any booty which might happen to be left to them.</p>
<p>On one of these occasions Narvaez had dispatched a large body of
horse to scour the surrounding country. They had started on their raid
at an early hour of the morning and while it was yet dark, so that by
the hour of sunrise they had penetrated far into hostile country. The
officer in command of the expedition rode a few bow-shots ahead, and to
his surprise suddenly encountered a Moorish youth who had lost his way
in the darkness, and who was now returning home. With great boldness
the young man faced the Spanish horsemen, but was quickly overpowered,
and when they learned from him that the district in which they were was
little more than a desert, having been stripped of all its resources by
the inhabitants who had abandoned it, they returned to Antequara, where
they brought their captive before Narvaez.</p>
<p>The prisoner, a young man of about twenty-three years of age, was of
handsome and dignified appearance. He was dressed in a flowing robe of
rich mulberry-coloured silk, gorgeously decorated in the Moorish
manner, and was mounted on a magnificent horse of the Arab breed. From
these indications, Narvaez judged him to be a cavalier of importance.
He inquired his name and lineage, and was told that his prisoner was
the son of the Alcayde of Ronda, a Moor of high distinction, and an
implacable enemy of the Christians. But when Narvaez questioned the
young man himself, to his astonishment he found that he was unable to
reply to him. Tears <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304"
name="pb304">304</a>]</span>streamed down his face, and his utterance
was choked by sobs which seemed to rise from a heart overflowing with
grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I marvel to see thee,&rdquo; said Narvaez. &ldquo;That thou,
being as thou art, a cavalier of good race, and the son of a noble so
valiant as is thy father, should be thus cast down and weep like a
woman, knowing too what are the chances of war and having all the
appearance of a brave soldier and a good knight&mdash;this surpasses my
understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not weep because I have been taken captive,&rdquo;
replied the youth. &ldquo;The tears flow from mine eyes because of a
much deeper sorrow, compared with which my fallen state is as
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Struck by the young man&rsquo;s earnestness, and pitying his
position, Narvaez asked him sympathetically to confide to him the cause
of his sorrow. The cavalier, touched by the general&rsquo;s kindness,
sighed deeply, and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Governor, I have long loved a lady, daughter of the
Alcayde of a certain fortress. Many times have I fought in her honour
against the men of your race. In time the lady came to return my
affection, and declared herself willing to become my wife, and I was on
my way to her when, by evil chance, I encountered your horsemen and
fell into their hands. Thus I have lost not only my liberty, but all
the happiness of my life, which I believed I held in my hand. If this
does not seem to you to be worthy of tears, I know not for what purpose
they are given to the eyes of man, or how to make you understand the
misery I am suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bold Narvaez was much affected at the pitiful nature of his
prisoner&rsquo;s story, and being a man of sympathetic instincts and
generous heart, he at once resolved to do <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>what he could to
lighten the captive&rsquo;s sorrowful predicament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art a cavalier of good family,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and if thou wilt pledge me thy word to return to this place, I
will give thee permission to go to thy beloved and acquaint her with
the cause of thy failure to be with her this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moor gladly availed himself of his captor&rsquo;s indulgence,
gave Narvaez the required assurance, and that same night reached the
castle wherein his lady dwelt. Entering the garden, he gave the signal
by which he usually signified his presence there, and she immediately
came to the trysting-place agreed upon between them. She at once
expressed the greatest surprise that he had not arrived at the time he
had promised to be with her, and he explained the circumstances which
had attended his delay. On hearing what had occurred the lady was cast
into the deepest grief, and as her lover was attempting to console her
by every means in his power the hour of dawn reminded him of his pledge
to Narvaez, and how he had given his word as a soldier and a cavalier
to return to his captivity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing left but that I should return,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I have lost my own liberty, and God forbid that, loving
you as I do, I should bear you to a place where yours also would be in
danger. We must wait patiently until the time when I can obtain my
ransom, when I shall immediately return to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before this hour,&rdquo; replied the lady, &ldquo;you have
given me many proofs that you truly love me, but now you show your
attachment more plainly than ever in your desire for my safety, and for
that very reason I should be most ungrateful if I did not go with you
to share <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>your captivity. Therefore I shall accompany you
to the Christian prison for which you are destined. If you must be a
slave, so also shall I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady then commanded her waiting damsel to bring her jewel-case,
and when this had been done she mounted behind her lover. All night
they rode, and in the morning they arrived at Antequara, where they
presented themselves to Narvaez, who was no less struck with the
constancy of the lady than with the honour and fidelity of the young
Moorish cavalier. He immediately gave both their liberty, and, loading
them with presents and other marks of honour, accorded them permission
to return to their own land, providing an escort of troops to accompany
them until they had reached a place of safety.</p>
<p>This adventure, the love of the lady, the loyalty of the Moor, and
more than all the generosity of the high-souled Christian commander,
were greatly celebrated and applauded by the noble Saracens of Granada,
and were sung in the lays of their most distinguished poets and
chronicled by their annalists. And although this story in every way
partakes of the nature of romance, it has the additional merit of being
true.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6007" class="main">The Dream of King Alfonso</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A mysterious story indeed is that which tells of the
manner in which Don Alfonso, King of Galicia, one of the Christian
states which held out against the Moors, was haunted by a dream which
came to him again and again in the watches of the night, and which no
one might interpret, until at last he was forced to call to his aid the
occult science of those very enemies against whom the vision warned
him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the year 1086 the territories of Alfonso and other Christian
sovereigns were invaded by a vast army of Almoravide Moors, who,
sweeping over from Africa, menaced Central and Northern Spain. When he
learned of their advance Alfonso was engaged in the siege of Saragossa,
but in view of the danger which confronted him he joined his allies at
Toledo and prepared to give battle to the invaders, who, numerous in
themselves, had been reinforced by the Moors of the various Mohammedan
states in Spain. Before leaving Toledo Alfonso was visited by one of
those terrible visions of the night which, history tells us, have so
often prophesied the fall of nations. It appeared to him that he was
mounted on an elephant, and that beside him, on the flank of the great
beast, was placed an atambore or Moorish drum, which he beat with his
own hands. But the clamours which pealed forth from the instrument were
so loud and terrifying that he instantly awoke in terror and amazement.
At first he scoffed at the dream as nothing but a nightmare, but when
it returned again and again on the succeeding nights of his stay at
Toledo he began to feel that it must contain some element of awful
warning. Night after night he awoke in great terror, drenched with
perspiration, and with the echoes of the Eastern drum thundering in his
ear, until at last, in great disquietude, he resolved to ask the advice
of the learned men of his Court regarding what the vision might
portend.</p>
<p>With this object in view, he summoned to his presence the scholars
and sages of his retinue, as well as the bishops and priests, and even
the rabbis of the Jews who were his vassals, and who were more
profoundly skilled in divination and the interpretation of dreams than
any of his Christian subjects. When they had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>come
before him, he related the substance of his dream, which he described
very minutely, concluding his narration by saying: &ldquo;That which
most amazes and alarms me in this matter is the peculiarity of the
elephant which I see in my visions, and which is an animal not reared
in our country nor seen therein. In like manner, the atambore is not of
the form and kind which we have in use among us, nor is that either to
be seen in Spain. Wherefore do ye consider what these may portend, and
give me the signification thereof without delay.&rdquo;</p>

alt="Don Alfonso summons his Sages" width="491" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Don Alfonso summons his Sages</p>
</div>
<p>The wise men thereupon retired, and having considered the dream,
returned to the royal presence. &ldquo;Lord King,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;we are of opinion that this dream of yours was sent to signify
that you shall vanquish these great armies that the Moslems have
brought against you, that you shall despoil their camp and plunder it
of the riches it contains, and that you shall occupy their territory
and return victorious, with great honour and glory. Moreover, we
believe that your triumph will be made known through all parts of the
East, since the elephant which you nightly appear to bestride can be no
other than Juzef Aben Taxfin, King of the Moslems and lord of the
far-extending lands of Africa, who, like that animal, has been reared
in the deserts of that country. The strangely formed atambore which you
have sounded on these many nights implies the fame which shall echo
throughout the world, to every part of which it shall carry the
knowledge of your illustrious victories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alfonso listened to this interpretation with the utmost attention,
and when it concluded he said: &ldquo;It appears to me that you have
gone far from the true interpretation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>of my dream, seeing
that the explanation which my heart gives me is of a widely different
kind, for it announces to me nothing better than events of terror and
dismay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus spoken, the King turned his head, and, looking toward
certain Moorish knights who were his vassals, he asked them if
perchance they knew of any wise man of their nation who had skill in
the interpretation of dreams. They replied that they did know of one
such, and that there was in Toledo at that moment a wise man who taught
in one of the mosques and who would interpret the vision to the
satisfaction of the King.</p>
<p>Alfonso at once commanded that they should bring the sage before
him, and in a short space the Moorish cavaliers returned with the man
of whom they had spoken, the Faki Mohammed Aben Iza, who, however,
sternly refused to interpret the dream of an infidel, and when he
learned for what purpose he was required would not even set foot in the
palace. The Moorish knights in their dilemma told Alfonso that the
Faki&rsquo;s religious scruples would not permit him to appear in a
Christian court, and the King, who well knew the niceties of Mohammedan
law, contented himself with their assurance that they would bring him
the wise man&rsquo;s interpretation of the dream. They then entreated
the Faki to consider it, and as they pressed him urgently he replied:
&ldquo;Go to the King Alfonso and say that the accomplishment of his
vision is very near, and that its significance is after this wise. He
shall be vanquished, yea, in a disgraceful defeat, and with great
slaughter. He shall fly, with but few of his people, and the victory
shall remain with the Sons of the Prophet. Tell him, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>moreover, that this declaration is derived from
the Koran: &lsquo;Know ye not what your God has prepared for him of the
Elephant? Hath he not brought his force to nothing and rendered his
evil intentions of no avail? See ye not that he hath sent over them the
vultures of Babel?&rsquo; These words,&rdquo; continued the Faki,
&ldquo;foretold the downfall of Ibrahim, King of the Abbassides, when
he went forth with his army against Arabia, riding on a great elephant.
But God sent for his destruction the wild vultures of Babel, who cast
balls of glowing fire upon that host and turned his pomp into
wretchedness and the vileness of dust. As to the atambore which Alfonso
described, that signifies that the hour of his desolation is
approaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moorish cavaliers, as in duty bound, returned to the King and
acquainted him with the prophetic words of the Faki. On hearing them he
turned pale, and ejaculated: &ldquo;By the God of my worship, let this
your Al Faki tremble if he hath lied, for be sure that I will make of
him a warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after this King Alfonso assembled his host, an innumerable
multitude of foot-soldiers and more than eighty thousand cavalry,
nearly thirty thousand of whom were Arabs. With this array he marched
to the encounter with King Taxfin and his allies, and came face to face
with him near Badajoz, among the groves and plains called Zalacca,
about twelve miles from that city. The armies were divided by a river,
and across this Taxfin sent an insulting message to Alfonso, bidding
him either abjure the Christian faith or acknowledge himself his
vassal. When Alfonso read this missive he cast it to the earth in great
anger, and, turning haughtily to the envoy, said: &ldquo;Go and bid
Taxfin not to conceal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>himself in the battle, which if he
do not, we shall see each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certain circumstances affected the combat. Friday was the holy day
of the Moslems, Saturday was the Sabbath of the Jews, of whom there
were many in the Christian host, and Sunday that of the Christians, and
Alfonso had already requested Taxfin that truce should be observed on
these days, and the Moor had consented. But Alfonso considered himself
justified in attacking at the hour of dawn on the Friday morning. He
marshalled his host into two divisions, and set on. The Moorish King of
Seville had asked his astrologer to cast a horoscope with the intention
of discovering the fate of the day, and as this had been entirely
unfavourable to the Moslems they were somewhat disheartened. But as
they succeeded in withstanding Alfonso&rsquo;s first attack, the
student of the stars cast another mystical diagram, and on this
occasion found his prognostication more auspicious. The King of
Seville, inspired by the favourable prophecy, sat down in his pavilion
and, taking pen and parchment, dashed off the following verse, which he
sent for the inspiration of his ally, Taxfin:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">God&rsquo;s anger on the Christian horde</p>
<p class="line">Sends cruel slaughter by thy sword,</p>
<p class="line">While favouring stars announce to thee</p>
<p class="line">And to thy Moslems victory!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Taxfin was greatly inspirited by these words, and rode
up and down his ranks encouraging his men, but he had not much time to
do so, for King Alfonso, heading a terrific charge, dashed down on him
with all the mail-clad chivalry of Spanish Christendom. A sanguinary
and murderous conflict ensued. The Moslems stood their ground bravely,
but the heavy cavalry of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href=
"#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>Spaniards bore them down, and
overwhelmed them on all sides. The Moorish allies of the Christian
force now came into action, surrounding and hemming in the Arabs of
Andalusia, and the Moslem chroniclers tell us that the darkness
produced by that mass of men and horses was so great that those who
fought could no longer see each other, and grappled hand to hand, as in
an obscure night. At last Taxfin&rsquo;s forces began to retreat, and
broke into disorderly rout, closely pressed by the Christian cavalry.
The Moors of Seville alone stood their ground. Taxfin placed himself at
the head of his reserve and, charging with great fury, threw his
mounted columns directly at the pavilion of King Alfonso. This was but
slightly defended, and easily fell a prey to the Moslems, with all its
treasure. Alfonso, noting the advance of Taxfin, charged him in flank,
and the two principal leaders were soon engaged in furious battle. The
Moorish monarch rode among his men, exhorting them to constancy, and
crying out that the reward of their valour would be the crown of
paradise. As the result of his repeated charges the Christian host
began to give way, and on the renewed attack of Taxfin&rsquo;s allies,
who had before been beaten, fled in precipitate rout. Alfonso, seeing
that all was lost, and accompanied by five hundred followers only, rode
fast before the conquering Moors. It was with difficulty that he made
his escape to the city of Toledo, where he arrived with only a hundred
men.</p>
<p>From that day King Alfonso never regained heart, and some years
later, on learning of the death of his son and the defeat of his people
in battle with the infidel, he fell sick and died. So was the prophecy
of the Faki fulfilled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e6061" class="main">The Prince who Changed Crowns</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the age-long struggle between the Gothic and
Arab races in Spain many small kingdoms on both sides rose and fell,
the names of which have long since been forgotten. Perhaps two hundred
years after the infidels had gained a footing in the Peninsula, it
chanced that in the central portion of the country there existed side
by side two diminutive kingdoms, or rather principalities, the more
northerly of which preserved its Spanish nationality with the most
jealous care, while that which existed upon its borders was equally
conservative in its Moslem prejudices. At this period the Spanish
principality had at the head of its fortunes a prince of exceptional
enlightenment and ability, Don Fernando. His training had naturally
been of a kind which had led him to regard his Moslem neighbours with
the profoundest distrust and dislike. They were, he was told by his
instructors, a race of men lost to all humanity, deficient in honour,
cruel, malicious, and revengeful&mdash;in short, it is not to be
wondered at that, having the demerits of his Saracen neighbours so
constantly dinned into his ears, the young Fernando began to regard
them with the utmost repugnance.</p>
<p>The low range of hills which divided the two principalities rather
assisted than hindered the constant raids which Moslem and Christian
made upon each other&rsquo;s territory, as they constituted a
description of No Man&rsquo;s Land, where the forces of either might be
carefully marshalled for a lightning foray. In these raids Fernando
himself occasionally took part, as it was thought necessary that the
prince of a state which lived in a condition of almost constant warfare
should be well acquainted with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>practical side of military
affairs. During one of these constantly recurring miniature invasions,
the company which Fernando commanded had ridden far into Moorish
territory without encountering any resistance, and, advancing in loose
formation and without sufficient care, suddenly encountered an
ambuscade of the enemy, who, taking it in flank, succeeded in
penetrating its ranks and cutting them in two. The little band of
Spaniards, thus separated, fled in opposite directions, and Fernando,
accompanied by only a handful of followers, turned his horse&rsquo;s
head in the direction of his own country and galloped out of the range
of immediate danger.</p>
<p>The route which he was now forced to take to regain his own
dominions necessitated his following a wide <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, and
as he and his companions had already ridden far that day their horses
shortly became so jaded that further progress was almost impossible.
They also became aware, to their dismay, that the foremost of the enemy
were now not far distant. In the dilemma in which they found themselves
they resolved to sell their lives dearly, as befitted Christian
knights, and they were about to dismount from their horses to seek a
spot which might afford them some advantage in such a struggle when
they beheld, some little way off, a building of rough stone standing on
a little eminence. &ldquo;There, if anywhere,&rdquo; said Fernando,
&ldquo;we shall be able to make a good defence. Let us secure that
position and take full advantage of the shelter it offers
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spurring their beaten horses to a last effort, they soon gained the
summit of the little hill. Dismounting, Fernando sought for the
entrance to the rather dilapidated building, and having found it, was
about to make his way inside, when he was surprised to see a man
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>kneeling on its flagstones, engaged in earnest
prayer. His long beard, his patched clothing, and his general
appearance signified that he was a Moslem hermit, one of those who had
retired from the haunts of men to practise his religious austerities in
peace. Fernando was about to address him roughly and bid him begone,
when the holy man, hearing the ring of his mailed foot upon the
pavement, looked up and asked him what he required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get you gone,&rdquo; said Fernando, &ldquo;for we are about
to defend this place to the last extremity against your infidel
brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hermit smiled. &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
possible defence can you hope to make in this poor place against the
numbers which will shortly surround you? Your sword and that of your
companions will be of little more avail than these poor walls, which,
almost ruined as they are, would soon be beaten down. Trust me, there
is a much better defence against the violence of man than either stone
or steel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not of what you speak, old man,&rdquo; said Fernando,
&ldquo;but in those things which you deride, I, as a soldier, have been
accustomed to place my trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;that it should be so!
Have you not been taught, young man, in your own country that God is a
surer defence to those who trust Him than those vain material bulwarks
which men of blood erect against one another&rsquo;s rage? Put your
trust in God, I say, and He will be able to succour you, even through
the least of His servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were it the God of the Christians of whom you speak,&rdquo;
replied Fernando, &ldquo;I would agree that your words were those of
wisdom, but in the mouth of an unbeliever they have naught but a
blasphemous ring.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href=
"#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;you are yet a
young man, but as you grow older it will be given you to understand
that God is the same in all lands, and that division of His personality
is one of the fictions with which the Father of Lies seeks to make
enmity between the righteous. Argue no longer, I pray you, but take
heed to what I say. This remnant of stone is the last remaining turret
of an ancient fortalice, beneath which extends a labyrinth of dungeons.
Secrete yourselves speedily in the darkness of this labyrinth, I beg
you, so that you may evade your pursuers and regain your own country
after nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care, Don Fernando,&rdquo; cried one of the
prince&rsquo;s comrades. &ldquo;This infidel seeks to beguile us into a
trap, where his countrymen will be able to murder us at their
leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied the prince, &ldquo;for I can see that
the mind of this good and holy man holds a better purpose toward us,
and I willingly yield myself to his care. Lead the way, good father, to
the hiding-place of which you speak.&rdquo; The hermit immediately
requested the cavaliers to enter the building, and indicated to them a
dark and sloping passage, down which they led their horses. They had
scarcely had time to conceal themselves in the gloomy recesses to which
it led when with a loud clamour the infidels who had been pursuing them
rode up. Their leader challenged the hermit and asked him if he had
observed any Christian knights pass that way. &ldquo;Assuredly no
Christian knights have <i>passed</i> this way, my son,&rdquo; replied
the man of God; &ldquo;go in peace.&rdquo; The Moslem captain with a
grave salutation immediately remounted his horse, and the band swept
on.</p>
<p>The hermit having entertained the Christian knights to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>the
best of his poor resources, returned to them within a few hours and
told them that darkness had now fallen. &ldquo;You will now be
able,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to make a safe return to your own
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I reward you?&rdquo; cried Fernando, whose generous
heart had been deeply stirred by the old man&rsquo;s unaffected
kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one way in which you can do so, young
cavalier,&rdquo; said the recluse, &ldquo;and that is by trying to form
a better opinion of the men of my race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask a difficult thing,&rdquo; said the prince sadly,
&ldquo;for truth compels me to say that I have heard great evil of the
Moors, and but little good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not surprising,&rdquo; said the hermit, with a smile,
&ldquo;since you will readily admit that you have not encountered them
otherwise than with sword in hand or as prisoners whose hearts are
burning with the bitterness of defeat. Open your mind, young man, or
rather pray that its doors, until now closed, should be thrown wide to
admit the rays of celestial wisdom. Seek for the best in your enemies,
and believe me you will not fail to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Fernando indeed felt as if the doors of his spirit,
until now rusty with prejudice, had been unbarred. &ldquo;I shall not
forget your advice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for surely nothing evil can
come from one so good and noble,&rdquo; and with a respectful gesture
of farewell he mounted his horse and, followed by his companions, rode
away.</p>
<p>He arrived safely in his capital in the early hours of the morning,
and having bathed and refreshed himself, sought his audience chamber,
where, surrounded by his anxious ministers, he told them of the
adventure which had befallen him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318"
href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Great has been your good fortune, your Majesty,&rdquo; said
one of his advisers. &ldquo;But for the services of this good man you
would certainly now have been a captive in the citadel of your enemies.
Surely few such spirits can reside in Moorish bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; replied the prince. &ldquo;May
it not be otherwise? When all is said and done, what do we know of the
Moors, save that knowledge which is gained by constant strife with
them? Would it not be well for us to strive to know them
better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried another councillor, &ldquo;do we not know
them for dogs and infidels, for perjured blasphemers and worshippers of
false gods? Heaven forbid that we should have further converse with
them than that of the herald, which serves to call us into the same
field as they, so that we may bring our lances to bear upon their
infidel bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These words seem to me neither good nor wise,&rdquo; said
Fernando gently; &ldquo;and I tell you, se&ntilde;ors, that while
riding home this morning I made a resolution to know those Moors
better, even to travel into their country, study their institutions and
their faith, and meet them as men rather than as enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madness!&rdquo; cried the Chancellor. &ldquo;The rash vow of
a young and inexperienced prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not my opinion,&rdquo; replied Fernando, &ldquo;but
in order to avoid all unnecessary risks I have resolved to disguise
myself as a Moslem. As you are aware, I have a perfect acquaintance
with the Moorish tongue, and the manners and religious customs of our
neighbours I know by report. I have taken this resolve, and am not to
be dissuaded from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;s word is law,&rdquo; replied the
Chancellor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>who saw in the prince&rsquo;s resolve an
opportunity for the extension of his personal power. Others of his
suite did their best to turn aside Fernando&rsquo;s resolution by every
argument in their power, but to no avail. His preparations were
speedily made, and within three days of announcing his determination
the prince, disguised as a Moslem of rank, set out by night for the
frontiers of his enemies.</p>
<p>On entering their country he resolved to make in the first place for
the capital, a town of considerable importance, on reaching which he
dismounted from his Arab steed and put up at a <i>khan</i>, or public
hostelry. Here he found himself in the company of travellers of all
sorts and conditions. The merchant sat at the same table with the
<i>mullah</i>, or priest, and the soldier shared his meal with the
pilgrim. The first thing that Fernando noticed regarding these people
was their great abstemiousness. They ate but little food, and drank not
at all, unless of milk or water. The atmosphere of gravity prevalent in
the inn surprised him. These sober, sallow-faced men sat, for the most
part, with downcast eyes, speaking rarely, and without gesticulation,
and in a low and decorous tone of voice. If asked a question, they did
not answer at once, but appeared to cogitate upon their reply, which
was invariably courteous and couched in formal but agreeable language.
All their conduct seemed to be subservient to decency and dignity.
Fernando noticed that they were spotless in their cleanliness. Not only
was this so as regards their garments, but they were constantly
performing ablutions, either in the inn itself during the stipulated
hours of prayer, or in the magnificent public baths of the city.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the disguised prince could not but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>see
that these men were one and all within the grip of a powerful
formalism, which had the effect of cramping and limiting their ideas,
and which was only too painfully evident in their speech and manners.
There seemed to be no room for individuality in their system of life.
He entered into conversation with one of the shaven <i>mullahs</i>, who
had retired into a corner the better to read his copy of the Koran. At
first he evinced but little inclination to talk, but seeing that the
prince wished to exchange ideas with him, he soon brought the
conversation round to the especial point of Moslem law he was studying,
upon which he split so many hairs that the hapless Fernando deeply
regretted that he had ever approached him.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e6149" class="main">Fernando Makes Comparison</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That night as Fernando lay in bed he summed up his
impressions of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people seem to me exceedingly formal and
conventional,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but against that we have to
place the garrulity and boisterousness of men of European race, their
frequent lack of dignity and too great familiarity of manner. That
<i>mullah</i>, too, was terribly long-winded, but have we not bores of
our own, and in plenty? Is it not the case that in all parts of the
world selfish introspection and scholarly pride frequently turn a man
into a public nuisance? It seems to me that the great bulk of mankind
merely acts in imitation of its fellows, and that only here and there
does one meet with a person of any outstanding
individuality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he arose next morning Fernando paid a visit to the great mosque
of the city. It was the first time he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>had entered a Moorish
place of worship, and he was struck by the circumstance that the
atmosphere which prevailed within it closely resembled that to be found
in a Christian cathedral. The same hushed silence was distinctly
noticeable. Here and there stood a <i>mullah</i>, or teacher,
instructing his disciples in Mohammedan law and ritual, and this
Fernando was rather pleased than otherwise to notice, as direct
instruction in the tenets of the Christian faith was but seldom to be
procured in the churches of his own country. Another thing he could not
but observe was the manifest learning and erudition of the speakers.
This seemed to him far in advance of the monkish accomplishments of his
own priestly subjects, whose learning was of the most slender
description, and but few of whom were able to write, and he was deeply
interested to find that in an annexe to the mosque, which was fitted as
a scrivenry or writing-room, a number of <i>mullahs</i>, old and young,
sat at desks writing swiftly in the Arabic script and engaged in the
multiplication of copies of the Koran and other works of a religious
nature.</p>
<p>From the mosque Fernando speedily found his way to the university,
and was soon lost in wonder at the rich intellectual life which
flourished there. In one room a white-robed teacher was lecturing upon
the practice of medicine with an acumen and ability he had never heard
equalled. His knowledge of drugs and chemistry and of the properties of
plants and herbs appeared to be both wide and exact, and when Fernando
thought upon the wretched leeches to whom so many of the lives of his
subjects annually paid forfeit he experienced a deep feeling of shame
that these swarthy yet studious foreigners were so easily able to
eclipse them in both <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322"
name="pb322">322</a>]</span>theory and application. But he was acute
enough to discern that the lecturer spoke of the medical art as a thing
the principles of which were already fixed beyond the power of
expansion. He spoke of experiment in the past tense, and all his
references were to the great teachers of the old world, to Galen and
Hippocrates, to Avicenna and to Rhazes. If he did chance to allude to
the teachers of his own day, it was in rather an apologetic manner, and
by no means in a complimentary sense. Antiquity was everything to him,
and the tenets of the old masters of medicine appeared to him quite as
sacred in their way as the words of the Prophet himself.</p>
<p>In an adjoining classroom Fernando lingered some time to listen to a
professor of astrology. This ancient art had always held a certain
fascination for him, and he was well aware that the Moors were among
its greatest interpreters. The lecturer described at length the
influences which the various planets had upon the destinies of man, the
manner in which their conjunctions and oppositions affected human
affairs, and the characters of persons born under certain astrological
conditions. This science too appeared to him incapable of extension or
fresh effort, and while hearkening to the speaker he found that though
he heard much that his common sense told him was incapable of definite
proof, he gleaned nothing of the nature of those planets themselves,
their physical movement, or their scientific relation to the earth. In
the geography classroom he found that instruction was based upon more
modern lines. The works of Arab travellers who had journeyed
extensively in Asia and Africa were touched upon. The conditions of
life in distant countries of the world were discussed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name="pb323">323</a>]</span>and
as a general rule with much greater exactitude than in the European
schools which he had visited, where fact was often subordinated to
fancy and where the extraordinary was prized at a much higher rate than
the probable.</p>
<p>Leaving the university, the court of which was filled to overflowing
with scholars who appeared to be disputing on various phases of
erudition, Fernando walked to the crowded market-place, a portion of
which, he observed, was given over to the sale of manuscripts, and this
part, he could not help noticing, was much better patronized than those
where food-stuffs and wearing apparel were for sale. In the more open
spaces jugglers and mountebanks, usually accompanied by performing
animals, went through all sorts of gambols and antics. Here and there
small knots of men discussed the more obscure points of the Koran or of
Mohammedan law, while others sat in shady corners, lazily drinking
sherbet or drowsing away the hot morning hours. In the booths which
surrounded the market-place he saw various tradesmen at
work&mdash;carpenters, smiths, sandal-makers, tailors&mdash;but he
noticed that the efforts of these were of the most leisurely
description, and that their tools were of a type much more antiquated
than those in use among the tradesmen of his own country. The hand of
time was indeed heavy upon the whole race. In some things it appeared
to have made great advances, while in others it seemed to have retained
the primitive ideas of the Dark Ages. Its progress seemed to have been
made in the realm of thought alone, but even here everything was
derivative and had reference to the experiments of an older age.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, however, Fernando felt that much <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>of
this conservatism touched a responsive chord within his own nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are these people not right,&rdquo; he argued with himself,
&ldquo;when they let well alone, as the proverb says? If they have
brought about a condition of things which suits them as a race, would
it not be folly in them to embark upon a career of experiment which
might prove wholly unsuitable to them? They seem reasonably happy and
contented. Suppose a condition of affairs such as obtains within my own
principality were suddenly to be forced upon them, would their
happiness not be changed into wretchedness? It must be that long
experience has taught them that their present manner of life is by far
the most convenient for them. Can it be that their dislike of us arises
from the great differences between our institutions and theirs? But,
again, is it not possible that these things are very much on the
surface? Their real natural sympathies and antipathies are, after all,
very similar to our own. They are entirely dependent upon the changes
of the seasons and upon the tillage of the earth for their food; they
live constantly in fear of warfare; the same private troubles between
man and man, between neighbour and neighbour, arise among them as among
ourselves; they are subject to the rule of authority precisely as we
are. The modifications of all these things are, after all, those of
place and circumstance, nor is it possible for any one individual among
them to break away from established custom, any more than it is in
Spain. We do not differ from them in the salient things of life, but
only in its surface details. Their religion teaches that the good are
rewarded and the bad punished, that a man must be constant in his
patriotic and domestic affections. After <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>all, had one of these
brown men been reared in Spain, at the age of twenty years he would
have been moved by the same prejudices as myself, and have become so
like me in every particular as to be indistinguishable from an ordinary
Spaniard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing through one of the gates of the city, Fernando walked into
the country. It very much resembled the rural portions of his own
principality, except that it was cultivated with greater care. Here and
there tiny, snow-white farm-steadings nestled in hollows, and from
these streams of reapers and gleaners spread across the fields in every
direction, for it was harvest-time. Fernando joined one of these
groups, and was surprised to find that there was little difference
between it and a similar party in Christian Spain. At intervals the
work of garnering the grain was relaxed, and the reapers sat in a
circle and listened to the music made by one of their number on the
pipe, which possessed a strange melancholy of its own. Fernando found
in them the same simple and easily satisfied disposition that he had
discovered among his own peasantry. They shared their bread and cheese
with him, and tendered him a draught of goat&rsquo;s milk from a large
skin bottle, which he made shift to swallow with rather a wry face, for
princes as a rule do not accustom themselves to the pungent odours of
such a beverage. Thus refreshed, he passed on, walking slowly through
the heat of the day, which was now well advanced, and resting every now
and then beneath the shadows of the roadside trees.</p>
<p>He had advanced perhaps a mile and a half farther on when he came to
a wide, open plain upon which he beheld a large body of Moorish cavalry
performing military evolutions. His soldier&rsquo;s eye took in the
scene <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>with interest, and he was quick to see that the
rapid movements of these lightly armed horsemen were greatly superior
to those of his own heavily accoutred warriors. At the word of command
the squadrons wheeled and charged with surprising unanimity and
rapidity, and when the word was given to halt they did so on the
instant, without scattering or losing the alignment of their ranks. The
evolutions of one of the squadrons brought it quite close to where the
prince was standing, and the officer in command, evidently regarding
him as a pilgrim of sanctity, gave him a courteous salutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it, reverend sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from the
evident pleasure with which you regard this scene, that you have once
been a soldier yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; replied Fernando; &ldquo;I was a
soldier for many years, and saw a good deal of service in another part
of the country; but war is no longer my business, and I do not, as I
once did, cherish it for itself alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;war is the only
career to which a noble mind can turn? You are young, and have
evidently left its ranks too early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; rejoined the prince, &ldquo;I am ready, if
necessity enjoins, to take up the sword once more, but only in case of
unrighteous invasion or to settle a grievous wrong. As I have said, I
no longer desire war for its own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the soldier, smiling, &ldquo;you do not mean
that we should be unprepared for attack? We know not the moment at
which the rude and savage Christians from the north may send a
multitude of warriors against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do they know, my friend, when we shall take it into our
heads to make a foray into their lands,&rdquo; said Fernando.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;if we were to do so, it
would only be as a protective measure after all, for we are well aware
that they will never become reconciled to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we ever tried to discover that?&rdquo; asked Fernando.
&ldquo;I fear not. We have certainly made treaties with them, but these
seem to have been made for the very purpose of being broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the officer, his lip curling, &ldquo;they
are treacherous dogs, these Spaniards, upon whose word no honest man
can rely. They have broken treaty after treaty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not mistaken,&rdquo; said Fernando, &ldquo;we
have done the same, only our rulers take extraordinary care that the
people shall not be acquainted with the full measure of our national
dishonesties, but shall be told that it was necessary to act in such
and such a manner because of the untrustworthy nature of our enemies.
May I ask, sir, if you have ever travelled in Christian Spain, or have
known other Christians than those whom you may have chanced to take as
prisoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cavalryman shook his head. &ldquo;Now I come to think of
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have crossed swords with more Spaniards
than I have bandied words with, but I do not doubt, as you imply, that
there are noble spirits among that people, for I know out of my own
experience that they are stout men of war, and a brave soldier can
scarcely be other than an honourable man. But you will excuse me, sir;
I can remain no longer. In the name of God, I wish you a pleasant
journey.&rdquo;</p>

title="Source: Fernndo">Fernando</span> Meets his
&ldquo;Double&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fernando passed on his way, and this day in his
wanderings may be taken as representative of many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>another. For three months he wandered through
the Moorish land, studying its institutions and its people at first
hand, and gleaning a practical insight into the national
characteristics. At the end of that time he had conceived such a high
opinion of his one-time foes that it was with heartfelt sorrow that he
turned his steps northward to the borders of his own principality.
Loath to cross them, he resolved to spend the night at a small
<i>khan</i> on the Moorish side of the hills. It was a poor place, but
beautifully situated at the entrance to a peaceful little valley.
Giving his horse to the white-robed ostler, he entered. To his utter
amazement, the first person he encountered was a young man who so
closely resembled himself that he started back in surprise and dismay,
for there was not a lineament in the stranger&rsquo;s countenance which
was not mirrored in his own. The young man thus confronted also halted
abruptly, and stared at his living counterpart; then a smile broke over
his pleasant face, and he said, with a laugh: &ldquo;I see, sir, you
are as surprised as myself, but I hope you are not angry that God has
made us so alike, for I have heard that people who closely resemble one
another are apt to cherish a mutual distrust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is small danger of that, friend,&rdquo; said Fernando,
&ldquo;for if God has made our minds as like each other as He has
fashioned our bodies, I am convinced that you are of a liberal and
unconventional disposition,&rdquo; and, laughing heartily, he indicated
a table. &ldquo;It would be fitting,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that
we should break bread together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried the other; &ldquo;I accept your
invitation with all the goodwill in the world.&rdquo; And, seating
themselves at the rough board, the two young men were soon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>engaged in an animated conversation. Much as
they had been surprised at the physical resemblance between them, they
were even more astonished at the close similarity they bore to one
another in taste and disposition. For hours they sat in close
discussion. At last the stranger said: &ldquo;I feel as if we had known
each other for a lifetime, and as I am certain that I can trust you
thoroughly, I will reveal to you my secret. Know then that I am Muza,
the prince of this country, and that I am even now returned from a
prolonged journey in the land of the Christians, whose character and
customs it had long been my desire to study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am indeed honoured by your Majesty&rsquo;s condescension
and confidence,&rdquo; replied Fernando, &ldquo;and you may rest
assured that your secret will remain inviolate with me. But may I ask
what opinion you formed of the inhabitants of Christian Spain during
your sojourn among them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a high opinion,&rdquo; replied Muza, &ldquo;that it is
with the greatest regret that I quit their country, for I find among
them a spirit so much more in consonance with my own than that of my
native subjects that I solemnly assure you I had much rather rule over
them than over my own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have then your wish, noble Muza,&rdquo; said Fernando,
rising, &ldquo;for I am none other than Fernando, prince of the
Christians, who, impelled by a similar desire, has been travelling in
your dominions, and who has conceived such a strong predilection for
the character and customs of its people that he asks nothing better
than to be permitted to guide their destinies. That I am what I
represent myself to be you may know by this token,&rdquo; and,
searching beneath his burnous, Fernando <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>drew out a gold
chain, from which was suspended his royal signet. &ldquo;There is, so
far as I can see,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but one possible bar to
our compact, and that is the difference between our
religions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Fernando,&rdquo; said Muza, with uplifted hands,
&ldquo;I find no difficulty in that, for, as I understand the matter,
the difference is merely one of exteriors. The inward spirit of our
faiths is the same, and it is only in their outward manifestations that
they present any divergency. Both spring from the one God, Who designed
them for the uses of differently constituted races, and if you agree
with me that this is so, there should be no greater difficulty in our
embracing the religions of each other&rsquo;s people than in accepting
their customs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heartily agree,&rdquo; replied Fernando, &ldquo;but what I
fear is that we shall not be able to convince our respective peoples of
the purity of our motives. They certainly must not share our
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our great safeguard,&rdquo; said Muza, &ldquo;is the
extraordinary resemblance between us, but it will be necessary that we
should instruct each other in our past histories, and in the
intricacies of our personal affairs, in order that ignorance of these
may not give rise to suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak like a wise man,&rdquo; rejoined Fernando;
&ldquo;let us address ourselves to this business at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far into the night the two young princes sat initiating each other
into the intimacies of their respective national diplomacies and
personal relationships, and at last, when morning broke, they parted
with every mark of mutual esteem, mounted their horses, and rode off,
Fernando to the capital of the Moor, Muza to that of the Christian. But
ere they parted they agreed to meet at the inn where they had first
forgathered at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>least once in three months, in order to discuss
any eventualities which might arise.</p>
<p>Three months passed rapidly, and, prompt to the day, the two young
rulers met once more at the inn. There was a noticeable stiffness in
the manner of their greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how fare you, noble Muza, in the kingdom of my
fathers?&rdquo; asked Fernando.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Muza, &ldquo;I am
constrained to say that I fare but ill. Every day your advisers present
to me new schemes of aggression against my late kingdom to which I can
give no manner of countenance, and they upbraid me bitterly with what
they are pleased to call my disloyalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely the same thing has happened to myself,&rdquo; said
Fernando, &ldquo;and may I say, with all due regard to the race from
which you spring, that they do not compare in liberality of outlook
with my own, that they are extremely conservative, and difficult of
comprehension!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; said Muza, &ldquo;I find your
people much too active and unruly, and I do not encounter the same
implicit obedience to which I have hitherto been accustomed. If I may
say so, there is a want of dignity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find some of my personal relations awkward too,&rdquo;
groaned Fernando; &ldquo;your matrimonial arrangements, for
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your lack of the same,&rdquo; replied Muza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the whole I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Fernando.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fully agree,&rdquo; replied Muza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we put the matter in a nutshell,&rdquo; remarked Fernando,
&ldquo;it is better for a man&mdash;even a liberal-minded
one&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>to remain in the bosom of his own people, for no
matter how broad his views may be, among strangers he must constantly
be doomed to encounter much which will tend to strengthen his
prejudices against them and create odious comparisons and
regrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more I agree,&rdquo; said Muza. &ldquo;When once the
novelty wears off&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; responded Fernando. &ldquo;After all, what
country can compare with that in which one has been born?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two princes parted, each to take his way to his native land.
But, despite the threats and entreaties of their advisers, neither of
them would ever again consent to make war upon the dominions of the
other, and it was even hinted by disgruntled and badly disposed persons
that Fernando and Muza met occasionally on their common frontiers for
the sole purpose of settling difficulties which had arisen between
their respective states&mdash;an unnatural proceeding which they avowed
was bound sooner or later to end in political disaster. <span class=

<h2 id="xd19e6287" class="main">Chapter XII: Tales of Spanish Magic and
Sorcery</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Spain seems to have been regarded by the other
countries of Western Europe as the special abode of superstition,
sorcery, and magic, probably because of the notoriety given to the
discoveries of the Moorish alchemists, the first scientists in Europe.
But with the coming of the Inquisition a marked and natural falling off
is noticeable in the prevalence of occult belief, for anything which in
the least tended to heresy was repressed in the most rigid manner by
that illiberal institution. In this way much of the folk-lore and
peasant belief of Spain, many fascinating legends, and many a curious
custom have been lost, never to be recovered. The Brothers, in their
zeal for the purity of their Church, banished not only the witch, the
sorcerer, and the demon from Spain, but also the innocent fairy, the
spirits of wood and wold, and those household familiars which harm no
one, but assist the housewife and the dairymaid.</p>
<p>The first information we receive that the authorities intended a
campaign against the whole demonhood, good and evil, of Spain is
contained in a work by Alfonso de Speria, a Castilian Franciscan, who
wrote, about 1458 or 1460, a work specially directed against heretics
and unbelievers, in which he gives a chapter on those popular beliefs
which were derived from ancient pagan practices. The belief in witches,
whom he calls <i>xurguine</i> (<i>jurguia</i>) or <i>bruxe</i>, seems
to have been imported from Dauphin&eacute; or Gascony, where, he tells
us, they abounded. They were, he says, wont to assemble at night in
great numbers on a high tableland, carrying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>candles with them, for the purpose of
worshipping Satan, who appeared to them in the form of a boar, rather
than in that of the he-goat in which he so frequently manifested
himself in other localities.</p>
<p>Llorente, in his <i>History of the Inquisition in Spain</i>, states
that the first <i>auto-de-f&eacute;</i> against sorcery was held at
Calabarra in 1507, when thirty women charged with witchcraft by the
Inquisition were burnt. In the first treatise on Spanish sorcery, that
of Martin de Castanaga, a Franciscan monk (1529), we learn that Navarre
was regarded as the motherland of Spanish witchcraft, and that that
province sent many &lsquo;missionaries&rsquo; to Aragon to convert its
women to sorcery. But we find that the Spanish theologians of the
sixteenth century were so much more enlightened than those of other
countries that they admitted that witchcraft was merely a delusion, and
the punishment they meted out to those who believed in it was inflicted
in respect that the belief, erroneous though it was, was contrary to
the tenets of the Church. Pedro de Valentin, in a treatise on the
subject (1610), entirely adopts the opinion that the acts confessed to
by the witches were imaginary. He attributed them partly to the manner
in which the examinations were carried out, and to the desire of the
ignorant people examined to escape by saying what seemed to please
their persecutors, and partly to the effect of the ointments and
draughts which they had been taught to use, which were composed of
ingredients that produced sleep and acted upon the imagination and the
mental faculties.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6313" class="main">The Religion of Witchcraft</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This view is very generally held at the present time
as accounting for the phenomena of witchcraft. But the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>researches of Charles Godfrey Leland, Miss M. A.
Murray, and others, seem to indicate that the cult of witchcraft is by
no means a thing of the imagination. The last-named writer, indeed,
claims that it is the detritus of an ancient pagan faith surviving into
modern times, having a priesthood and well-defined ritual of its own,
and in a measure conserving the practice of child-sacrifice.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that this conception of witchcraft is the
correct one. In the records of the caste there are numerous proofs that
it had a definite ritual and an established priesthood, and that
imagination played but a small part in shaping the belief of the
adherents of the cult.<a class="noteref" id="xd19e6321src" href=

<h3 id="xd19e6328" class="main">The Story of Dr Torralva</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Spain had not in the sixteenth century ceased to be
celebrated for its magicians, who still retained a modicum of the
occult philosophy of the Moorish doctors of Toledo and Granada. Perhaps
the most celebrated of these comparatively modern masters of magic was
Doctor Eugenio Torralva, physician to the family of the Admiral of
Castile. Educated at Rome, he early became a pronounced sceptic, and
formed an intimacy with a certain Master Alfonso, a man who, after
changing his Jewish faith for Islam, and that again for Christianity,
had at last become a free-thinker. Another evil companion was a
Dominican monk called Brother Pietro, who told Torralva that he had in
his service a good angel called Zequiel, who had no equal in the
spiritual world as a seer, and was besides of such a disinterested
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>temperament that he served only those who had
complete confidence in him and deserved his attachment.</p>
<p>All this excited Torralva&rsquo;s curiosity to an unbounded degree.
He was one of those people, fortunate or otherwise, in whom the love of
mystery has been deeply implanted, and when Pietro generously proposed
to resign his familiar spirit to his friend&rsquo;s keeping he eagerly
accepted the offer. Nor did Zequiel himself offer any opposition to
this change of master, and, appearing at the summons of Pietro, assured
Torralva that he would follow his service as long as he lived, and
wherever he was obliged to go. There was nothing very startling in the
appearance of the spirit, who was dressed in a flesh-coloured habit and
black cloak, and had the appearance of a young man with an abundance of
fair hair.</p>
<p>From this time onward Zequiel appeared to Torralva at every change
of the moon, and as often as the physician required his services, which
was generally for the purpose of transporting him in a short space of
time to distant places. Sometimes the spirit assumed the appearance of
a hermit, at others that of a traveller, and even accompanied his
master to church, from which circumstance Torralva concluded that he
was a beneficent and Christian-minded spirit. But, alas! Dr Torralva
was to find, like many another, that attendance at the sacred edifice
is not necessarily a guarantee of piety.</p>
<p>For many years Torralva continued to reside in Italy, but in the
year 1502 he felt a strong desire to return to the land of his birth.
He did so, but seems to have made Rome his headquarters once more in
the following year, placing himself under the protection of his old
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>patron, the Bishop of Volterra, now become a
cardinal. The influence this connexion brought him proved of the
greatest service to him, and he soon rose to high repute for his skill
in medicine. But neither the pious cardinal nor any of the other
distinguished patients who sought his aid knew that he drew practically
all his medical knowledge from his unseen famulus, who taught him the
secret virtues of young plants, with which other physicians were not
acquainted. Zequiel, however, was untainted by the love of lucre; for
when his master pocketed those &lsquo;thumping&rsquo; fees to which all
good physicians aspire the spirit rebuked him, telling him that since
he had received his knowledge for nothing he ought to impart it
gratuitously. On the other hand, did the doctor require funds, he never
failed to find a supply of money in his private apartment, which he
knew implicitly must have been placed there by his familiar.</p>
<p>Torralva returned to Spain in 1510, and lived for some time at the
Court of Ferdinand the Catholic. One day Zequiel confided to him that
the King would shortly receive some very disagreeable news. Torralva at
once communicated this piece of intelligence to Ximenes de Cisneros,
Archbishop of Toledo, and to the Grande Capitan, Gonzalvo
Hern&aacute;ndez de Cordova. On the same day a courier arrived from
Africa bearing dispatches which informed his Majesty that an expedition
against the Moors had met with disaster, and that its commander, Don
Garcia de Toledo, son of the Duke of Alva, had been slain.</p>
<p>When in Rome it appears that Torralva had been so indiscreet as to
summon Zequiel to appear before his patron, Cardinal Volterra, who now,
hearing of the manner <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href=
"#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>in which his
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> had &lsquo;prophesied&rsquo; the disaster
to the Spanish arms, acquainted the Archbishop of Toledo with the means
by which the doctor had received intelligence of the defeat. Torralva,
ignorant of this, continued in his forecasts of political and other
events, and soon found his reputation as a seer greatly enhanced. Among
others who consulted him was the Cardinal of Santa Cruz, to whom a
certain Donna Rosales had complained that her nights were disturbed by
a frightful phantom, which appeared in the form of a murdered man. Her
physician, Morales, had watched at night with the lady, but although
she had pointed out the precise spot where the grisly vision took its
stand, he could discern nothing.</p>
<div class="figure xd19e6352width" id="p338"><img src="images/p338.jpg"
alt="Torralva and the Spirits" width="500" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Torralva and the Spirits</p>
</div>
<p>Torralva accompanied Morales to the lady&rsquo;s house, and, seated
in an ante-chamber, they heard her cry of alarm about an hour after
midnight. Entering her apartment, Morales again confessed his inability
to see the apparition, but Torralva, who was better acquainted with the
spiritual world, perceived a figure resembling a dead man, behind which
appeared a shadowy female form. &ldquo;What dost thou seek here?&rdquo;
he inquired, in a firm voice, whereupon the foremost spirit replied:
&ldquo;I seek a treasure,&rdquo; and immediately vanished. Torralva
consulted Zequiel upon the subject, and upon his advice the cellars of
the house were dug up, whereupon the corpse of a man who had been
stabbed to death with a poignard was discovered, and upon its receiving
Christian burial the visitations ceased.</p>
<p>Among Torralva&rsquo;s intimate friends was one Don Diego de
Zu&ntilde;iga, a relative of the Duke of Bejar, and brother of Don
Antonio, Grand Prior of the Order of St John in Castile. Zu&ntilde;iga
had consulted the learned doctor as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>to how he could gain
money at play by magical means, and Torralva informed him that this
could be accomplished by writing certain characters on paper, using for
ink the blood of a bat. This charm Torralva advised him to wear about
his neck, so that he might experience good luck at the
gaming-table.</p>
<p>In 1520 Torralva went once more to Rome. Ere he left Spain he told
Zu&ntilde;iga that he would be able to travel there astride a
broomstick, the course of which would be guided by a cloud of fire. On
his arrival at Rome he interviewed Cardinal Volterra, and the Grand
Prior of the Order of St John, who earnestly begged him to abandon all
commerce with his familiar spirit. Because of their exhortations,
Torralva requested Zequiel to leave his service, but met with a stern
refusal. The spirit, however, advised him to return to Spain, assuring
him that he would obtain the place of physician to the Infanta
Eleanora, Queen-Dowager of Portugal, and later consort of Francis I of
France. Acting upon this counsel, Torralva sailed once more for the
land of his birth, and obtained the promised appointment.</p>
<p>In 1525 an incident occurred which greatly enhanced Torralva&rsquo;s
celebrity as a seer. On the 5th of May of that year Zequiel assured him
that the troops of the Emperor would take Rome on the following day.
Torralva desired the spirit to carry him to Rome so that he might
witness this great event with his own eyes. Zequiel gave him a stick
full of knots, and commanded him to shut his eyes. Torralva obeyed the
request of the famulus, and when after a space the spirit told him to
open his eyes once more, he found himself in Rome, standing on a high
tower. The hour was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340"
name="pb340">340</a>]</span>midnight, and when day dawned he duly
witnessed the terrible events which followed&mdash;the death of the
Constable of Bourbon, the flight of the Pope into the Castle of St
Angelo, the slaughter of the citizens, and the wild riot of the
conquerors. Returning to Valladolid by the same means as that by which
he had come, Torralva immediately made public all he had seen, and
when, a week or so later, news arrived of the capture and sack of Rome,
the Court of Spain was very naturally filled with unbounded
surprise.</p>
<p>Many persons of high rank had been accomplices of the gifted doctor
in his practice of the black art, and one of these, in a fit of
remorse, notified the Holy Inquisition of his dealings with the
supernatural. Zu&ntilde;iga too, who had benefited so greatly by the
occult knowledge of Torralva, now turned against him, and denounced him
to the Holy Office of Cuen&ccedil;a, which had him arrested and cast
into prison. The terrified magician immediately confessed all his
doings with Zequiel, whom he persisted in regarding as a beneficent
spirit, and penned no less than eight declarations of his dealings with
the supernatural, some of which contradicted statements made in others
in a most ludicrous manner. In view of their unsatisfactory nature, the
unhappy necromancer was put to the torture, and an admission of the
demonic nature of his familiar was quickly extracted from him. In March
1529 the Inquisitors suspended his process for a year, a common
practice of the Inquisition, which thus attempted to wear its victims
down. But, to the dismay of Torralva, a new witness made his
appearance, who testified that in his early days at Rome the imprisoned
medico was prone to indulgence in occult arts, so that in January 1530
Torralva was once more put upon his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>trial. The
Inquisition appointed two learned theologians to labour for his
conversion, to whom Torralva promised amendment in everything, except
the renunciation of the evil spirit with whom he had been associated
for so long, assuring his mentors that he had not the power to dismiss
Zequiel. At length, on his making a pretence to cast off his familiar
and abjure his heresies, he was released, and entered the service of
the Admiral of Castile, who had employed all his influence to obtain a
pardon for him. Immortalized in the pages of <i>Don Quixote</i>, he
remains for all time the archetype of the Spanish magician of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6377" class="main">Moorish Magic</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By no race was the practice of the occult arts studied
with such perseverance as by the Moors of Spain, and it is strange
indeed that only fragmentary notices of their works in this respect
remain to us. The statement that they were famous for magical and
alchemical studies is reiterated by numerous European historians, but
the majority of these have refrained from any description of their
methods, and the Moors themselves have left so few undoubted memorials
of their labours in this direction that we remain in considerable
ignorance of the trend of their efforts, so that if we desire any
knowledge upon this most recondite subject we must perforce collect it
painfully from the fragmentary notices of it in contemporary European
and Arabic literature.</p>
<p>The first name of importance which we encounter in the broken annals
of Moorish occultism is a great one&mdash;that of the famous Geber, who
flourished about 720&ndash;750, and who is reported to have penned
upward of five hundred works upon the philosopher&rsquo;s stone and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>elixir of life. In common with his
fellow-alchemists, he appears to have failed signally in his search for
those marvellous elements, but if he was unable to point the way to
immortal life and boundless wealth, he is said to have given mankind
the nitrate of silver, corrosive sublimate, and nitric acid. He
believed that a preparation of gold would heal all diseases in both
animals and plants, as well as in human beings, and that all metals
were in a condition of chronic sickness in so far that they had
departed from their natural and original state of gold. His works, all
of which are in Latin, are not considered authentic, but his <i lang=
"la">Summa Perfectionis</i>, a manual for the alchemical student, has
frequently been translated.</p>
<p>The Moorish alchemists taught that all metals are composed of
varying proportions of mercury and sulphur. They laboured strenuously
to multiply drugs out of the various mixtures and reactions of the few
chemicals at their disposal, but although they believed in the theory
of transmutation of metals they did not strive to effect it. It
belonged to their creed rather than to their practice. They were a
school of scientific artisans and experimentalists, first and last.
They probably owed their alchemical knowledge to Byzantium, which in
turn had received it from Egypt; or it may be that the Arabs drew their
scientific inspiration at first hand from the land of the Nile, where
the &lsquo;great art&rsquo; of alchemy undoubtedly had its birth.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6391" class="main">Astrology</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Astrology was also an important branch of occult study
with the Moors of Spain, whose consideration of it greatly assisted the
science of mathematics, especially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343"
href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>that branch of it which still
retains its Arabic name&mdash;algebra (<i>al</i> = the, <i>jabara</i> =
to set, compute). It is probable that the Arabs first received an
insight into the practice of foretelling events by the position of the
planets at a given time from the Chaldeans, who undoubtedly were its
earliest students. References to astrology are plentifully encountered
in Spanish story, as the reader will have observed. But high as it
stood in the estimation of the Moorish sages, it was still subservient
to the grander and more mysterious art of magic, whereby the spirits of
the air could be forced to do the will of the magus, and carry out his
behests in four elements. Most unfortunately, we are almost entirely
ignorant of the tenets of Moorish magic, owing probably to the
circumstance that it was averse to the spirit of Islam. But we know
that it was founded upon Alexandrian magic, and therefore recognized
the principles of that art as laid down by the great Hermes
Trismegistus, who was none other than the Egyptian Thoth, the god of
writing, computation, and wisdom.</p>
<p>About the end of the tenth century the learned men of Europe began
to resort to Spain for the purpose of studying the arts, occult and
otherwise. Among the first to do so was Gerbert, afterward Pope
Sylvester II, who spent several years in Cordova, and who introduced
into Christendom the knowledge of the Arabic numerals and the no less
useful art of clock-making. Strange that he did not apply his knowledge
of the one to the other, and that even to-day our timepieces are
burdened with the old and cumbrous Roman numerals! William of
Malmesbury assures us that Gerbert made many discoveries of treasure
through the art of necromancy, and relates how he visited a magnificent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>subterranean palace, which, though dazzling to
the sight, would not remain when its splendours were subjected to the
test of human touch. Ignorant Europe took Gerbert&rsquo;s mathematical
diagrams for magical signs, and his occult reputation increased as his
moral character withered. It was said that the Devil had promised him
that he should not die until he had celebrated high mass at Jerusalem.
One day Gerbert celebrated his office in the Church of the Holy Cross
of Jerusalem at Rome, and, feeling ill, asked where he was, observed
the <i>double entendre</i> of the Evil One, and expired. Such was the
tale that benighted ignorance cast round the memory of this
single-minded and enlightened man, much in the same spirit as it
bedevilled the recollections of our own Michael Scot and Roger
Bacon.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6411" class="main">The Dean of Santiago</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the <i>Conde Lucanor</i>, a Spanish collection of
tales and homilies of the fourteenth century, already alluded to, is a
story of the Dean of Santiago, who went to Illan, a magician of Toledo,
to be instructed in necromancy. The magus raised a difficulty, saying
that as the Dean was a man of influence, and would attain a high
position, he would probably forget all past obligations. The Dean,
however, protested that no matter to what eminence he attained he would
not fail to remember and assist his former friends, and particularly
his tutor in things supernatural. Satisfied with the churchman&rsquo;s
promises, the necromancer led his pupil to a remote apartment, first
requesting his housekeeper to purchase some partridges for supper, but
not to cook them until she had definite orders to do so. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the Dean and his instructor had settled themselves to the
business before them, they were interrupted in their labours by a
messenger, who came to inform the Dean that his uncle, the Archbishop,
had summoned him to his death-bed. Being unwilling, however, to forgo
the instruction he was about to receive, he excused himself from the
duty. Four days later, another messenger arrived, informing the Dean of
the Archbishop&rsquo;s death, and later he learned that he had been
appointed Archbishop in his uncle&rsquo;s place. On hearing this, Illan
requested the vacant deanery for his son. But the new Archbishop
preferred his own brother, inviting, however, Illan and his son to
accompany him to his see. Later the deanery became vacant once more,
and once again the magician begged that his son might be appointed to
it. But the Archbishop refused his suit, in favour of one of his own
uncles. Two years later the Archbishop became a cardinal, and was
summoned to Rome, with liberty to appoint his successor in the see.
Once more Illan was disappointed. At length the Cardinal was elected
Pope, and Illan, who had accompanied him to Rome, reminded him that he
had now no excuse for not fulfilling the promises he had so often made
to him. The Pope, in anger, threatened to have Illan cast into prison
and starved as a heretic and sorcerer. &ldquo;Ingrate!&rdquo; cried the
incensed magician, &ldquo;since you would thus starve me, I must
perforce fall back upon the partridges I ordered for to-night&rsquo;s
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he waved his wand, and called to his housekeeper to
prepare the birds. Instantly the Dean found himself once more in
Toledo, still Dean of Santiago, for, indeed, the years he had spent as
Archbishop, Cardinal, and Pope were illusory, and had existed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>only in his imagination at the suggestion of the
magus. This was the means the sage had taken to test his character,
before committing himself to his hands, and so crestfallen was the
churchman that he had nothing to reply to the reproaches of Illan, who
sent him off without permitting him to sup upon the partridges!</p>
<p>It is strange that physicians and priests figure most notably as the
heroes of Spanish magical story&mdash;strange, until we reflect upon
the manner in which the learned classes were regarded by an illiterate
and illiberal commonalty. Torquemada tells a story of a youth of his
acquaintance, a young man of great ability, who was afterward physician
to the Emperor Charles V. When he was a student at Guadalupe, and was
travelling to Granada, he was invited by a traveller, dressed in the
garments of a churchman, whom he had obliged in some manner, to mount
behind him on his horse, and he would carry him to his destination. The
horse seemed a sorry jade, unable to carry the weight of two
able-bodied men, and at first the student refused the mount, but, on
pressure, at length accepted a seat behind the seeming ecclesiastic.
The horseman requested his companion not to fall asleep in the saddle,
and they jogged on, without any appearance of their going at an
extraordinary rate. At daybreak, to the student&rsquo;s surprise, he
found himself near the city of Granada, where the horseman left him,
marvelling that the distance between two places so widely separated
could have been covered in a single night.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6428" class="main">Spectres and Apparitions</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As might be imagined, the strong vein of superstition
in the Spanish character, if subdued to some extent by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>the
harsh dictates of the Holy Office, yet rose triumphant in other spheres
of occult belief. We find, for example, a widely diffused belief in the
power of the dead to return to the scenes of previous existence, and
this superstition is well illustrated by a weird passage in the
thrilling and mysterious pages of Goulart, who in his <i lang=
"fr">Tr&eacute;sor des Histoires admirables</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd19e6436src" href="#xd19e6436" name="xd19e6436src">2</a> knows well
how to mingle shadows with the colours on his palette.</p>
<p>He tells us how Juan Vasquez Ayala and two other young Spaniards, on
their way to a French university, were unable to find suitable
accommodation at a certain village where they had halted for the night,
and were obliged to take shelter in a deserted house, the reputation of
which as a haunted vicinity had flourished for a considerable time
among the villagers.</p>
<p>The young men made the best of matters, borrowed articles of
furniture from several neighbouring houses, and resolved to give a warm
reception to any supernatural visitant who should have a mind to pay
them a call. But on the first night of their occupancy they had
scarcely fallen asleep when they were awakened by a noise as of
clanking chains, which seemed to proceed from the lower regions of
their temporary dwelling.</p>
<p>Absolutely fearless, young Ayala leaped from his bed and, donning
his clothes, sallied downstairs in search of the cause of the clamour
which had awakened himself and his comrades. In one hand he carried his
drawn sword, in the other a lighted candle, and on coming to a door
which led to the courtyard of the house he perceived a dreadful
spectre&mdash;a grisly skeleton, standing in the entrance. The grim
apparition which confronted him was loaded with chains, which clanked
with a doomful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>and melancholy sound on the ears of the gallant
young student, who, however, undismayed by the spectacle before him,
advanced the point of his sword and demanded the intruder&rsquo;s
reason for disturbing his rest. The phantom waved its arms, shook its
bony head, and beckoned with its hand, as if asking Ayala to follow it.
The student expressed his willingness to do so, on which the ghost
commenced to descend a flight of steps, dragging its legs as it went
like a man whose limbs were weighted with iron shackles. Ayala followed
fearlessly, but as he advanced his candle suddenly flickered and went
out, a circumstance which did little to reinforce his courage.
&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; he called to the phantom. &ldquo;You perceive my
candle has gone out. If you will wait till I relight it, I shall return
in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rushing to a light which burned in the hall, he relit his candle,
and returned to the spot where he had left the apparition. He entered
the garden, where he saw a well, close by which he perceived the ghost,
which signed to him to continue his progress, and having gone a little
way forward, vanished.</p>
<p>Puzzled, the student returned to his apartment, and told his
comrades to accompany him to the garden, but search as they might,
nothing could they find. Next day they reported what had occurred to
the <i>alcalde</i> of the village, who had the garden examined, with
the result that immediately beneath the spot where the phantom had
disappeared a skeleton was exhumed, loaded with chains. When proper
burial had been given to the remains the noises in the house abruptly
ceased, but the adventure proved too much for the superstitious
Spaniards, who returned home abruptly, without fulfilling the object of
their journey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>This tale is a capital example of the typical ghost story in its
earliest phase. I will not descant upon it here, as a book on Spanish
romance and legend is scarcely the place for a disquisition on the
occult. But we are learning, slowly and painfully perhaps, to regard
these matters from another point of view than our Victorian
grandfathers, whose materialism pooh-poohed the supernatural without
trying to account for it. In any case I am one of those who believe in
it and who desire to believe in it, so that the reflections of such a
biased person are perhaps better dispensed with.</p>
<p>Torquemada tells a gruesome story of one Antonio Costilla, a Spanish
gentleman, who one day left his mansion, well mounted, on a matter of
personal business. When he had ridden several leagues, night suddenly
fell, and he resolved to return to his home, but to his dismay he was
overtaken by the darkness, and seeing a light ahead rode his horse at a
walk in its direction. He saw that it proceeded from a small hermitage,
and, dismounting, he entered the little chapel and engaged in prayer.
As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he saw that he was not
alone, for the hermitage was occupied by three persons, who lay upon
the ground, wrapped in black mantles. They did not address him, but lay
regarding him with wild, melancholy eyes. Terrified, he knew not by
what, he leaped into the saddle and rode off. In a little while the
moon shone out, and showed him the three men whom he thought he had
left in the chapel riding a little in front of him on black horses. In
order to avoid them, he turned down a by-path, but to his horror still
observed them riding a few paces ahead. Spurring madly on, yet always
preceded by those whom he desired to avoid, he came in time to the gate
of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>own house, where he dismounted, and led his
horse into the courtyard&mdash;only to find there the three cloaked
figures awaiting him. He rushed into the house, and entered his
wife&rsquo;s apartment, calling for help. Instantly the entire
household came to his assistance, but although he screamed loudly that
the three fiends or apparitions stood by the couch on which he had
thrown himself, they were invisible to all others. A few days later the
wretched Costilla died, maintaining to the last that three forms with
glaring eyes stood over his bed, menacing him with frightful
gestures.</p>
<p>Pity it is that our knowledge of the supernatural as manifested in
Spain is so slight and fragmentary. But the dread of the
sorcerer&rsquo;s fate was heavy upon the people, and the fear of
torture by rack or fire successfully banished witch, wizard, fay, and
phantom from the fields and cities of the Peninsula. <span class=

<h3 id="xd19e6480" class="main">Cervantes&rsquo; &ldquo;Don
Quixote&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cervantes was one of the world&rsquo;s great
satirists, a man gifted with a keen and peculiar sense of the
ridiculous. He would himself have been the first to laugh at those
modern critics who professed to see in him a great poet, and indeed, at
the end of his days, when he assessed his life&rsquo;s work in his
mock-heroic <i>Voyage to Parnassus</i>, he admitted that he had not the
poetic gift. That he had a golden imagination is obvious to anyone who
cares to read his <i>Galatea</i>, imitative as it is, and <i>Don
Quixote</i> overflows with imagination and invention, although certain
later passages of the wondrous satire are extremely reminiscent of some
of its earlier pages.</p>
<p>To me <i>Don Quixote</i> has always seemed one of the most precious
and curious of books, but probably for very different reasons from
those by which it makes its appeal to the majority of people, for it is
because of the information it affords concerning romantic literature
and customs that I treasure it most. Where the satire is really
legitimate I revel in the fun as much as it is possible for anyone to
do, but I feel that many of its passages are rather shabbily
iconoclastic, and that some of its strictures are levelled not only
against the absurdities of chivalric extravagance, but against the
whole spirit and structure of romance. It had been well, too,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>for Cervantes had he confined himself entirely
to the satiric vein, for when he essays to employ the very literary
vehicle at which he chiefly scoffed he frequently becomes more
maudlin&mdash;that is the only word for it&mdash;than the most
sentimental writers against whom he girds. His shepherds and
shepherdesses and his runaway nuns are long-winded and pedantic, and he
was indeed badly bitten by that tiresome Arcadian phase in European
literature which culminated in the prose pastoral, which had its roots
in false conventions and employed as its <i lang="fr">mise en
sc&egrave;ne</i> an atmosphere of sham rural felicity. Sannazaro, in
his <i>Arcadia</i>, had indeed piped the tune to which Cervantes danced
for many a day ere his own strong common sense showed him the fatuity
of the models which he followed. The author of the <i lang="es">Pastor
de Filida</i>, Luiz Galvez de Montalvo, was his own close friend, and
there is every evidence that he made wholesale raids upon the
distinctly minor efforts of such poetasters as Hebrao and Alonso Perez.
The works of the men who composed this school of pseudo-Arcadianism had
none of the charm of the delightful canvases of Watteau and Fragonard,
silk-coated and satin-gowned though their shepherds and shepherdesses
be. The country of the Spanish pastoral had a background of pasteboard
scenery, and theatrical effects of lighting flashed across its stage.
It was peopled by bores of the most intolerable description, who,
instead of looking after their live stock, as they were paid to do,
wearied each other and the wretched traveller who was unhappy enough to
encounter them with their amorous bellowings and interminable tales of
misfortune. Little wonder that the native good sense of Cervantes
recoiled later from this unworthy and unmanly nonsense. But it is
extraordinary that although he meted out such <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>merciless treatment to chivalric romance, he
still retained a weakness for the follies of Arcady, from which, to the
last, he was unable to free himself.</p>
<p>The circumstances of Cervantes&rsquo; career undoubtedly assisted
him to discipline his ideas. As a collector of taxes he had, perforce,
to come into contact with the seamy side of life, and much of his time
was spent in the Bohemian atmosphere of inns, where he was compelled to
lodge while he worked the district allotted to him. In these
circumstances and in these places he encountered men and women of flesh
and blood, and came up against the iron wall of hard, solid reality.
Such an experience is undoubtedly most valuable to a man of romantic or
imaginative temperament, gifted with creative ability. It tempers his
natural capacities and enlarges his views. Doubtless Cervantes, when he
first went his rounds, had been in the habit of regaling his
fellow-travellers in the <i lang="es">posadas</i> in which he sojourned
with high-falutin stories of errant shepherds and wandering
shepherdesses. We can imagine the degree of amusement with which the
rough muleteer, the blunt soldier, and the travelling quack would greet
those sallies. The criticism of such people is not strained&mdash;it is
annihilating! Can we doubt that the laughter with which his earlier
rhapsodies were received in company of this sort blew away the
fantastic cobwebs from Cervantes&rsquo; brain?</p>
<p>I have already indicated that in the age in which he lived the
romance proper had fallen into considerable popular disfavour. This was
due partly to the circumstances of a changed environment, and partly to
the type of literary opinion which had recently been fostered by the
rise of the Spanish drama, which had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>brought about an
entirely new literary ideal. Can it be that Cervantes, finding that his
audiences regarded the Arcadian type of tale with disfavour, attributed
this to the circumstance that it was fashionable in high circles, and
fell back upon the romance, only to find that it too was greeted with
guffaws and laughed out of the inn parlour? Was it in the quips and
sneers of such audiences, the very antithesis of the romantic
personages of whom he had dreamed, that the idea of <i>Don Quixote</i>
took shape in his brain, and that in the laughter of clowns and men of
the hard world, of the struggling lower middle class, he perceived the
certain popularity which a caricature of chivalry would enjoy? So, it
seems to me, it may have been.</p>
<p>For many a year the sham romance of chivalry had been regarded as a
pest. Serious and responsible writers had thundered against it, and
there is every evidence that in a measure it stood between a certain
section of the people of Spain and anything like mental advancement. It
had, indeed, turned the heads of that portion of the nation
unaccustomed to think for itself, and unable to form a rational opinion
regarding its demerits. In all countries and at all times, this class,
usually impressionable and easily led, falls an easy prey to the
blandishments of the hack writer of sensational proclivities. It is not
too much to say that unhealthy sensationalism in literature constitutes
a real and active danger to national well-being. It seduces the people
from their duties, unfits them for the serious business of life,
renders them pretentious rather than independent, and leads them to the
belief that they reflect the virtues or vices of the absurd heroes and
heroines of their favourite tales. The one weapon which the more
sensible portion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355"
name="pb355">355</a>]</span>of the community can bring to bear against
such a pernicious condition of affairs is healthy ridicule, which it
usually meets with from the rational and the well-balanced. But the
danger exists that in the revulsion of public feeling against literary
extravagance not only the absurdities which have obsessed the
thoughtless and irritated the sensible will undergo destruction and
banishment, but those higher virtues and graces of which they are the
distorted reflection will not be discriminated against, but will be
demolished along with them. Such, indeed, was the fate which befell the
greater romances, those jewels of human imagination, which, although
Cervantes himself made an effort to save them, shared in the general
wreck and ruin of the fiction of which they were the flower, until the
taste and insight of a later day excavated them from the
super-incumbent mass under which they lay buried.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6529" class="main">The Figure of Don Quixote</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Don Quixote, the central figure of the mighty satire
which gave its death-blow to chivalry, is perhaps typical of the
romance reader of Cervantes&rsquo; day. Crack-brained and imaginative
to the verge of madness, he is entirely lost to the uses of everyday
existence. He lives in a world of his own, and has nothing in common
with that of his time, to the spirit of which he cannot adapt himself.
In this gentleman of La Mancha the vices of the imagination are well
portrayed, but they are unaccompanied by those gifts through which
imagination can be rendered of utility to the community. Don Quixote
dwells on the heights of a chivalric Parnassus, a land of magic peopled
by the spectres and shadows which he has encountered in the books with
which his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>library is so well furnished. His imagination is
thus not even creative, but derivative; reliance upon the &ldquo;idols
he has loved so long&rdquo; has &ldquo;done his credit in men&rsquo;s
eyes much wrong,&rdquo; and he is regarded by his neighbours as an
amiable lunatic of no importance. But the dreamer, when roused to
action, can be a very terrible person if his visions chance to direct
him astray, and if he attempt to realize a nightmare. Thus it was with
Don Quixote. Scarcely mad enough for confinement, but yet sufficiently
crazy to become a public nuisance, if not a public menace, he justly
typifies the kind of person in whom romance runs mad, and is thus of
the same class as the small boy who is incited to acts of petty larceny
by the perusal of detective stories, or the young lady behind the
ribbon-counter who is under the impression that she is the long-lost
daughter of a mysterious peer.</p>
<p>It is symptomatic of such craziness that it craves companionship. It
is indeed a species of vanity which must have an audience, however
small or however unsuited to its purposes. Again, the element of
conspiracy is as the apple of its eye, and it must confide its ideas
and aspirations to one sympathetic ear at least. In Sancho Panza, Don
Quixote finds a strange confidant. The luckless peasant is completely
unable to comprehend his master&rsquo;s point of view, but is carried
away by his rodomontades and the glib and gorgeous promises of
preferment and prosperity which the crack-brained knight holds out to
him. To his participation in the wild scheme of the visionary Don,
Sancho&rsquo;s shrewd spouse violently objects, but when dreamer and
dunce get together common sense may hold its tongue and content itself
with the knowledge that it is not until <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>windmills have been
tilted at and sound trouncings have been received that its advice will
be listened to.</p>
<p>But though he begins his travels as a dunce, Sancho by no means
remains one. He profits from his experiences, and almost every page
shows him increasing in judgment and in that humour which is the salt
of good judgment. As his master grows madder, Sancho grows wiser, until
at last he becomes capable of direction and guidance toward the rueful
knight. As we proceed we begin to suspect that the peasant-squire
exists as a kind of chorus to illustrate the excesses of his master and
criticize his absurdities. But apart altogether from Don Quixote,
Sancho Panza is a striking and arresting figure in modern fiction,
possessing a philosophy of his own, rich in worldly wisdom and
abounding with practical ability. On the humorous side he is equal to
Falstaff, only whereas Falstaff&rsquo;s humour is typically English
that of Sancho Panza is universal. He is a world-clown, with the
outlook of a philosopher and the unconscious humour of a Handy
Andy.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6542" class="main">The Adventure at the Inn</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The true measure of the character of Don Quixote is
perhaps met with in that chapter which recounts what occurred to him in
the inn which he took for a castle. The place seems to have been a very
ordinary Spanish <i>posada</i>. The host and hostess were kindly folk
whom the knight at once exalted to the rank of a castellan and
ch&acirc;telaine, and in the dowdy maidservant, who has been
immortalized under the name of Maritornes, he saw a great lady who
dwelt in their company. After the terrible trouncing he had received
from the Yanguesian carriers the wretched knight was glad to rest his
battered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>limbs in a miserable garret of the place, while
Sancho explained to the inn-folk the nature of a knight-errant and the
vicissitudes of errantry, which one day compelled its adherents to
undergo such hardship as the Don now suffered from, and the next
exalted them to the heights of sovereignty over many empires. These
explanations were seconded by the Knight of the Rueful Countenance
himself, who, sitting up in bed, entertained the hostess and
maidservant to a speech so grandiloquent that, lost in wonder at his
eloquence, &ldquo;they admired him as a man of another world.&rdquo;
But Don Quixote, anxious to recover from his injuries, begged his
squire to procure from &ldquo;the governor of the castle&rdquo; the
ingredients of a magical balm of which he had read in some book of
chivalry. These he obtained, and Don Quixote busied himself by
concocting the enchanted liquor over the fire, saying over it many
credos and paternosters. Then he drank deeply of the awful compound,
with distressing effect, and Sancho, following his example, underwent a
similar but more violent experience, and was assured by his master that
the balsam disagreed with him because he had not received the order of
knighthood!</p>
<p>Saddling his horse, the knight was about to proceed on his journey,
but before he set out he assured &ldquo;the lord governor of the
castle&rdquo; how deeply grateful he was for the honours he had
received while under his roof. The innkeeper suggested that the time
for paying his reckoning had come, but Don Quixote retorted that it was
impossible for him to do so, as no knight-errant of whom he had ever
read was wont to pay for board and lodging. The innkeeper protested
loudly, whereupon, clapping spurs to Rozinante, the knight rode out at
the gate. The innkeeper then attempted to extort his dues from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>Sancho Panza, but without avail, as the squire
quoted the same authorities as his master, whereupon some of those who
sojourned at the inn seized him and tossed him in a blanket. Don
Quixote, hearing his cries, rode back, but although he stormed loudly
the travellers still continued to toss Sancho in the blanket, until at
length, tired of the exercise, they let him go.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6556" class="main">Don Quixote&rsquo;s Love-Madness</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the space at our disposal it would be impossible to
follow Don Quixote step by step through the land of false romance which
he had created for himself. We will recall how Amadis on the Firm
Island bemoaned his separation from his lady-love, and how, when he
came to a locality known as the Black Mountain, Don Quixote resolved to
follow the example of the great hero of chivalry. Before he left his
native village he had placed his affections upon a country wench, to
whom he gave the romantic name of Dulcinea del Toboso, and now that he
had come to the Black Mountain he resolved to spend his time in
meditation upon the virtues and beauties of this super-excellent
damsel. After lecturing Sancho Panza upon the duty of a knight-errant
in meditation upon his lady, he became irritated with the squire
because he could not understand the reason for his amorous fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; quoth Sancho, &ldquo;what is it that you
mean to do in this fag-end of the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I not already told thee,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote,
&ldquo;that I intend to copy Amadis in his madness, despair and fury?
Nay, at the same time I will imitate the valiant Orlando
Furioso&rsquo;s extravagance when he ran mad, at which time in his
frantic despair he tore up trees <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360"
href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>by the roots, troubled the
waters of the clear fountains, slew the shepherds, destroyed their
flocks, and committed a hundred thousand other extravagances worthy to
be recorded in the eternal register of fame.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd19e6567width" id="p360"><img src="images/p360.jpg"
alt="Don Quixote&rsquo;s Love-madness" width="486" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Don Quixote&rsquo;s Love-madness</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; quoth Sancho, &ldquo;I dare say the knight who
did these penances had some reason to be mad. But what lady has sent
you a-packing, or even so much as slighted you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the point,&rdquo; cried Don Quixote, &ldquo;for in
this consists the singular perfection of my undertaking. It is neither
strange nor meritorious for a knight to run mad upon any just occasion.
No, the rarity is to run mad without a cause, without the least
constraint or necessity, for thus my mistress must needs have a vast
idea of my love. Waste no more time, therefore, in trying to divert me
from so rare, so happy, and so singular an imitation. I am mad and will
be mad until you return with an answer to the letter which you must
carry from me to the Lady Dulcinea. If it be favourable, my penance
shall end, but if not, then shall I be emphatically mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Body o&rsquo; me!&rdquo; quoth Sancho, &ldquo;why run you on
at such a rate, Sir Knight? All these tales of yours of the winning of
kingdoms and bestowing of islands rather appear to me as so much
braggartry, and now this latest mood of yours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now as I love bright arms,&rdquo; cried the Don, &ldquo;I
swear that thou art an addle-pated ass. Know you not that all the
actions and adventures of a knight-errant seem to be mere
chim&aelig;ras and follies? Not that they are so, but merely have that
appearance through the malice and envy of powerful
enchanters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they talked they came near to a high rock, round <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>which the wild trees, plants, and flowers grew
in profusion, and here the Knight of the Woeful Figure resolved to
perform his amorous penance. Throwing himself on the ground, he broke
into a loud frenzy of grief. &ldquo;Go not yet,&rdquo; he cried to
Sancho, &ldquo;for I desire that thou shalt be a witness of what I will
do for my lady&rsquo;s sake, that thou mayst give her an account of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless us,&rdquo; cried Sancho, &ldquo;what can I see more
that I have not seen already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing as yet,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote. &ldquo;Thou must
see me throw away mine armour, tear my clothes, knock my head against
the rocks, and do a thousand other things of that kind that will fill
thee with astonishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware, sir,&rdquo; cried the squire. &ldquo;If you needs
must knock your noddle, do so gently, I pray you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6591" class="main">The Army of Sheep</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But surely the most mirth-provoking of all the
adventures of Don Quixote is that in which he takes a flock of sheep
for an army. He and Sancho were riding at bridle-pace over a wide
plain, when they perceived a thick cloud of dust in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day is come,&rdquo; cried the knight, &ldquo;the happy
day that fortune has reserved for me, and in which the strength of my
arm shall be signalized by such exploits as shall be transmitted even
to the latest posterity. Seest thou yonder cloud of dust? Know then
that it is raised by a prodigious army marching this way and composed
of an infinite number of nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wretched Don&rsquo;s brain was of course full to overflowing of
the accounts of those stupendous battles of myriads of paynims which,
as we have seen, are so frequently encountered in the old romances, and
he was delighted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362"
name="pb362">362</a>]</span>when Sancho pointed out that two separate
hosts seemed to be approaching from different points of the
compass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, so!&rdquo; cried Don Quixote, flourishing his lance,
&ldquo;then shall we assist the weaker side. Know, Sancho, that the
host which now confronts us is commanded by the great Alifanfaron,
Emperor of the Island of Taprobana. The other that advances behind us
is his sworn enemy, Pentapolin of the Naked Arm, King of the
Garamantians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; quoth Sancho, &ldquo;what is the cause of
this quarrel between two such great men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a simple matter,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote.
&ldquo;The pagan Alifanfaron dares to make his addresses to the
daughter of Pentapolin, who has told him that he will have naught of
him unless he abjure his false beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a battle be at hand,&rdquo; said Sancho nervously,
&ldquo;where shall I place my ass, for I fear he will not prove of much
avail in the charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote. &ldquo;We will soon
provide a destrier for thee when the knights begin to fall from their
saddles. But let us scan their ranks. He who wears the gilded arms and
bears on his shield a crowned lion couchant at the feet of a lady is
the valiant Lord Luarcalco, Lord of the Silver Bridge. Yonder is the
formidable Micocolembo, the great Duke of Quiracia, wearing armour
powdered with flowers of gold. The gigantic form upon his right is the
dauntless Brandabarbaran, sovereign of the Three Arabias, whose armour
is made of serpents&rsquo; skins, and who carries for a shield the gate
of the temple which Samson pulled down at his death. But our allies
also advance. Yonder marches Timonel of Carcaxona, Prince of New
Biscay, who bears on his shield a cat <i>or</i> in a field
<i>gules</i>, with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href=
"#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>motto &lsquo;Miau.&rsquo; Beside
him rides Espartafilardo of the Wood, whose blue shield is powdered
with asparagus plants. But the pagans press on. To the right cluster
those who drink the pleasant stream of the Xanthus, there the rude
mountaineers of Massilia, behind them those who gather gold from the
sands of Arabia Felix, the treacherous Numidians, the bowmen of Persia,
the Medes and Parthians who fight flying, the houseless Arabians, and
the sooty Ethiopians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; cried Sancho, &ldquo;surely thy
magicians are at work again, for not a single knight, giant or man can
I see of all those you talk of now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blockhead!&rdquo; cried Don Quixote. &ldquo;Hark to the
neighing of countless horses, the fanfare of the trumpets, and the
thunder of many drums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely this is sorcery,&rdquo; replied the puzzled Sancho,
&ldquo;for I hear nothing but the bleating of sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Retreat, if thou fearest the engagement,&rdquo; replied the
Don, with a haughty sneer, &ldquo;for I with my single arm am
sufficient to give the victory to that side which I shall favour with
my assistance,&rdquo; and with a loud and warlike cry he couched his
lance, clapped spurs to the lean side of Rozinante, and charged like a
thunderbolt into the plain, crying: &ldquo;Courage, brave knights! Woe
upon that great infidel Alifanfaron of Taprobana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment he was among the flock of sheep, charging through
and through it, and piercing an animal at each thrust of his lance. The
shepherds, in great dismay, unloosed their slings and began to ply him
with stones as big as their fists. But, disdainful of this petty
artillery, he cried upon Alifanfaron, whom in imagination he was about
to engage, when a stone as big as a good-sized pippin struck him
heavily upon the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364"
name="pb364">364</a>]</span>short ribs. Thinking himself desperately
wounded, he pulled out the earthen flask which contained his magic
balsam; but just as he was in the act of raising this to his lips, a
stone from the sling of a shepherd struck it so forcibly as to shiver
it to atoms, and passing through it broke three of his teeth and
tumbled him from the saddle. The shepherds, fearing that they had
killed him, picked up the dead sheep and made off, leaving him more
dead than alive.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e6633" class="main">Mambrino&rsquo;s Helmet</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No less notable is Cervantes&rsquo; account of the
adventure in which Don Quixote succeeded in obtaining the helmet of
Mambrino. At a distance he espied a horseman who wore upon his head
something that glittered like gold. Turning to Sancho, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, yonder comes he who wears upon his head the helmet of
Mambrino, which I have sworn to make mine own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the truth of the story,&rdquo; says Cervantes, &ldquo;was
this: there were in that part of the country two villages, one of which
was so little that it had not so much as a shop in it, nor any barber;
so that the barber of the greater village served also the smaller. And
thus a person happening to have occasion to be let blood, and another
to be shaved, the barber was going thither with his brass basin, which
he had clapped upon his head to keep his hat, that chanced to be a new
one, from being spoiled by the rain; and as the basin was new scoured,
it made a glittering show a great way off. As Sancho had well observed,
he rode upon a grey ass, which Don Quixote as easily took for a
dapple-grey steed as he took the barber for a knight, and his brass
basin for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>a golden helmet; his distracted brain easily
applying every object to his romantic ideas. Therefore, when he saw the
poor imaginary knight draw near, he fixed his lance, or javelin, to his
thigh, and without staying to hold a parley with his thoughtless
adversary, flew at him as fiercely as Rozinante would gallop, resolved
to pierce him through and through; crying out in the midst of his
career: &lsquo;Caitiff! wretch! defend thyself, or immediately
surrender that which is so justly my due.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barber, seeing this awful apparition come thundering down upon
him, and in terror lest he should be run through by Don Quixote&rsquo;s
lance, threw himself off his ass on to the ground and, hastily rising,
ran off at the top of his speed, leaving both his ass and his basin
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;the miscreant who
has left this helmet has shown himself as prudent as the beaver, who,
finding himself hotly pursued by the hunters, to save his life cuts off
with his teeth that for which his natural instinct tells him he was
followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; cried Sancho, &ldquo;it is a right good
basin, and worth at least a piece of eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Quixote at once placed it on his head, but could find no visor,
and when he perceived that it had none, &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;the pagan for whom this famous helmet was first made had a
head of a prodigious size, but unfortunately part of it is
wanting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Sancho laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy,&rdquo; continued Don Quixote, &ldquo;that this
enchanted helmet has fallen by some strange accident into the hands of
some one who for the lucre of a little money, and finding it to be of
pure gold, melted one half of it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366"
href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>and of the other made this
headpiece, which as thou sayest has some resemblance to a
barber&rsquo;s basin.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6658" class="main">The Adventure of the Windmills</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most celebrated, if not the most amusing of Don
Quixote&rsquo;s adventures is certainly that of the windmills. Indeed
&ldquo;tilting at windmills&rdquo; has passed into a proverb. The
dismal Don and his squire had entered a certain plain where stood
thirty or forty windmills, and as soon as the knight espied them he
cried: &ldquo;Fortune directs our affairs better than we ourselves
could have wished. See, Sancho, there are at least thirty outrageous
giants whom I intend to encounter, and with whose spoils we shall
enrich ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What giants?&rdquo; quoth Sancho Panza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those whom thou seest yonder,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote,
&ldquo;with their long, extended arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your leave, sir,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;those
things yonder are no giants, but windmills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thou art but
little acquainted with adventures. I tell thee they are giants, and
therefore if thou art afraid, turn aside and say thy prayers, for I am
resolved to engage in an unequal combat against them all.&rdquo;
Without another word he clapped spurs to his horse, crying out:
&ldquo;Stand your ground, ignoble creatures, and fly not basely from a
single knight who dares encounter you all!&rdquo; At that moment the
wind rose and the mill-sails began to move, at which the Don cried
aloud: &ldquo;Base miscreants! though you move more arms than the giant
Briareus, you shall pay for your arrogance.&rdquo; Then, devoutly
recommending himself to his lady, he bore down upon the first windmill,
and running his lance into the sail, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb367" href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>transfixed it. The
sail, however, continued to rise, drawing up both knight and horse
along with it, until at last the lance broke into shivers and Rozinante
and his master fell a good distance to the ground.</p>
<p>Sancho Panza at once ran up to the dismounted knight, who seemed to
have fared badly. &ldquo;Alas, your worship,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;did not I tell you they were windmills, and that nobody could
think otherwise unless he had windmills in his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, who had been badly shaken
by the fall. &ldquo;I am verily persuaded that the cursed necromancer
Freston, who continues to persecute me, has transformed these giants
into windmills. But, mark you, in the end all his pernicious wiles and
stratagems shall prove ineffectual against the prevailing edge of my
sword.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6677" class="main">The Story of the Captive</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the most remarkable of the tales which are
interspersed throughout the history of Don Quixote is that of the
captive which the hero encounters at a certain inn, and which, if it is
not actually based upon the facts of Cervantes&rsquo; own personal
captivity among the Moorish pirates, certainly draws much of its
substance and colour therefrom. On 26th September, 1575, the Spanish
vessel <i>Sol</i>, on which Cervantes served as a private soldier, was
separated from the rest of the Spanish squadron in the neighbourhood of
Marseilles, and, falling in with a flotilla of Moorish pirates, was
captured after a desperate resistance. Cervantes himself was sold as a
slave to one Dali Mami, a Greek renegade, who found upon his prisoner
certain highly eulogistic letters from Don John of Austria and the Duke
of Sessa. These flattering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href=
"#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>credentials led his new master to
suppose that Cervantes was a man of consequence, and that he would
presumably be able to draw a large ransom for him. But although the
great are often quite ready to provide genius with grandiloquent
testimonials which cost them only the expense of a little ink and
paper, they are by no means prone to back their assertions of ability
by tabling large sums of money, and Cervantes continued to languish in
captivity. In 1576 he attempted to escape with other prisoners, but
their Moorish guide played them false, and, threatened by hunger, the
party was forced to return to Algiers. In the following year
Cervantes&rsquo; brother was ransomed, and he undertook to send a
vessel to carry off Miguel and his friends. Meanwhile the author of
<i>Don Quixote</i> enlisted the sympathies of a Spanish renegade, a
Navarrese gardener named Juan. Between them they dug a cave in a garden
near the sea, and secreted in it, one by one, fourteen Christian
slaves, who were secretly fed during several months by the help of
another renegade known as El Dorador. The vessel sent by Rodrigo de
Cervantes stood in to the shore, and was on the point of embarking
those hidden in the cave when a Moorish fishing-boat passed by, and so
alarmed the rescuers that they put to sea again. Meanwhile the
treacherous El Dorador had revealed the plan to Hassan Pasha, the Dey
of Algiers, and when several of the crew of rescuers landed on a second
occasion to convey the fugitives on board, the Dey&rsquo;s troops
surrounded the garden, and the entire band of Christians was captured.
Cervantes, with that true nobility which characterized him throughout
life, took the entire blame of the conspiracy upon himself. Dragged
bound before Hassan, he adhered to his statement, and although the
unfortunate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>gardener was hanged, Hassan decided to spare
Cervantes&rsquo; life, and for some reason known to himself purchased
the poet from Dali Mami for five hundred crowns. Perhaps the tyrant
expected an immense ransom from a man whose nobility of bearing must
have impressed him. But be that as it may, Cervantes at once began to
set on foot a third scheme of escape. He sent a letter to the Spanish
<span class="corr" id="xd19e6691" title=
"Source: Governer">Governor</span> of Oran, asking for assistance, but
this was intercepted, and the poet was sentenced to two thousand blows,
which, however, were never inflicted. Cervantes now conceived the idea
of inducing the Christian population of Algiers to rise and capture the
city. In this project he was assisted by some Valencian traders, but
the scheme was revealed to Hassan by a Dominican monk, and the
Valencians, hearing of the priest&rsquo;s treachery, and fearing lest
they might be implicated, begged Cervantes to make his escape on a ship
which was about to start for Spain. But Cervantes refused to desert his
friends, and when he was once more dragged before Hassan with a
hangman&rsquo;s rope round his neck, and threatened with instant death
unless he revealed the names of his accomplices, he obstinately refused
to betray them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his family were doing their utmost to procure his release,
and in order that they might collect his ransom, his mother, the better
to inspire pity, actually passed herself off as a widow, though her
husband, a medical practitioner of great age, was still alive. By
tremendous exertions they succeeded in collecting two hundred and fifty
ducats, which they paid to a certain monk who went regularly to
Algiers, but this Hassan refused to accept, asking for one prisoner of
distinction, called Palafox, the sum of one thousand ducats. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>monk seems to have acted as an official ransomer
to the Spaniards, and when Hassan found that he would pay no more than
five hundred ducats for Palafox, he offered to ransom Cervantes for
that sum by way of making a bargain. So after five years of slavery the
author of <i>Don Quixote</i> was set free, and returned to his native
soil. But the Dominican monk who had revealed to Hassan his attempted
escape, and who was probably afraid that Cervantes would charge him
with this treachery, no sooner heard that he had landed in Spain than
he spread false reports regarding his conduct. These, however,
Cervantes was easily able to rebut, and his character as a heroic
leader among the captives was amply vindicated. The captive&rsquo;s
story, for which Cervantes had had the mournful privilege of collecting
so much &lsquo;local colour,&rsquo; is recounted to Don Quixote by an
escaped slave, who, with his Moorish lady-love, has come to the inn
where the woeful knight is sojourning. I shall adhere to
Cervantes&rsquo; manner of recounting it in the first person, but as it
occupies a considerable portion of the first part of his famous
history, considerations of space will necessitate its condensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My family had its origin in the mountains of Leon, and
although my father had considerable substance, he had by no means been
prudent in his expenditure, and at an early age my brothers and myself
were faced with the necessity for carving out our own fortunes. One of
my brothers resolved to go to the Indies, the youngest embraced Holy
Orders, and I concluded that for my part I would be a soldier. With a
thousand ducats in my pocket I travelled to Alicant, whence I took ship
to Genoa. From that city I went to Milan, where I joined the forces of
the great Duke of Alva and saw <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371"
href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>service in Flanders. Some
time after my arrival in that country there came news of the league
concluded by Pope Pius V in conjunction with Spain against the Turks,
who had at that time taken the island of Cyprus from the Venetians.
Hearing that Don John of Austria had been given the conduct of this
expedition, I returned to Italy, enrolled myself in his service, and
was present at the great battle of Lepanto, on which glorious day the
fable that the Turk was invincible, which had so long deluded
Christendom, was dissipated. But instead of participating in this
victory, I was so unfortunate as to be made a prisoner in the course of
the engagement. Vehali, the bold pirate king of Algiers, having boarded
and taken the galley <i>Capitana</i> of Malta, the vessel of Andrea
Doria, to which I had been commissioned, bore up to assist it. I leaped
on board the enemy&rsquo;s ship, which, however, succeeded in casting
off the grappling-irons thrown upon it, and I found myself surrounded
by enemies who quickly bore me down. I was carried to Constantinople,
and was made a slave in the captured <i>Capitana</i> at Navarino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I did not wish to burden my father with the collection of
a ransom, I refrained from letting him know of my circumstances. My
master Vehali dying, I fell to the share of a Venetian renegade called
Azanaga, who sailed for Algiers, where I was shut up in prison. As it
was thought that I might be ransomed, the Moors placed me in a
<i>bagnio</i>, and I was not forced to labour like those captives who
had no hope of redemption. Upon the courtyard of this place there
opened the windows of the house of a wealthy Moor, and it chanced one
day that I was standing underneath one of these, when there appeared
from it a long cane, to which was attached a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>piece of linen. This was moved up and down, as
if it was expected that some of us should lay hold upon it, and one of
our number stood immediately beneath it to see if it would be lowered.
But just as he came to it, the cane was drawn up and shaken to and fro
sideways, as if in denial. Another of my comrades advanced, and had the
same success as the former. Seeing this, I resolved to try my fortune
also, and as I came under the cane, it fell at my feet. I untied the
linen, and found wrapped up in it about ten gold coins called
<i>zianins</i>. I took the money, broke the cane, and looking upward,
beheld a white hand close the window in haste. Shortly afterward there
appeared out of the same casement a little cross made of cane, and by
this token we concluded that some Christian woman was a slave in that
house. But the whiteness of the hand and the richness of the bracelets
upon the arm made us think that perhaps we had to deal with a Christian
lady who had turned Mohammedan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For more than fifteen days we received no other token of the
lady&rsquo;s presence, although we watched carefully for the same, but
we learned that the house belonged to a Moor of high rank, called
Agimorato. At the end of this time the cane appeared once more, and on
this occasion I found that the linen bundle contained no less than
forty crowns of Spanish gold, with a paper written in Arabic, at the
top of which was a great cross. But none of us understood Arabic, and
it was with difficulty that we could find an interpreter. At last I
resolved to trust a renegade of Murcia, who had shown me great proofs
of his kindness. He agreed to translate it, and I found the contents
were as follow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As a child I had a Christian nurse who taught me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>much of your religion, and especially of Lela
Marien, whom you call the Virgin. When this good slave died, she
appeared to me in a vision and bid me go to the land of the Christians
to see the Virgin, who had a great kindness for me. I have seen many
Christians out of this window, but none has appeared to me so much of a
gentleman as thyself. I am young and handsome and can carry with me a
great deal of money and other riches. Pray consider how we may escape
together, and thou shalt be my husband in thine own country, if thou
art willing. But if not, it does not matter, for the Virgin will
provide me a husband. Trust no Moor with this letter, for they are all
treacherous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The renegade to whom I had given the letter for translation
promised to assist us in every way in his power, should we venture upon
making our escape, and indeed the hearts of all of us rose high, for we
argued that the influence and means of the lady who had befriended me
might greatly help us in our efforts for freedom. I dictated a reply to
the renegade, who translated it into the Arabic tongue, offering the
lady my services and those of my companions, and promising on the word
of a Christian to make her my wife. Soon the cane was let down from the
window once more. I attached the note to it and it was drawn up. That
night we prisoners discussed the best means of effecting our escape,
and at last we agreed to wait for the answer of Zoraida (for such we
discovered was the lady&rsquo;s name), feeling assured that she could
best advise us how to proceed.</p>
<p>For some days the <i>bagnio</i> was full of people, during which
time the cane was invisible, but when we were once more left to
ourselves it was thrust through the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>window, and on this
occasion the bundle which depended from it contained a letter and a
hundred crowns in gold. The renegade speedily translated the missive,
which stated that although the writer could not contrive the manner of
our escape, she could still furnish us with sufficient money to enable
us to buy our ransoms. She suggested that having done this one of us
should proceed to Spain, purchase a ship there, and return for the
others. She concluded by saying that she was now about to proceed to
the country with her father, and that she would pass all the summer in
a place near the seaside, which she closely described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one of our company offered to be the man who should go
to Spain and purchase the ship which was to deliver the rest, but the
renegade, who was experienced in such matters, strongly opposed this
proposal, saying that he had seen too many such enterprises wrecked by
placing trust in a single individual. He offered to purchase a ship in
Algiers, and pretend to turn merchant, by which means, he said, he
could contrive to get us out of the <i>bagnio</i> and the country.
Meanwhile I answered Zoraida, assuring her that we would do all she
advised, and in reply to this she gave us, by means of the cane, two
thousand crowns in gold. Of this sum we gave the renegade five hundred
crowns to buy the ship, and through the good offices of a merchant of
Valencia, then in Algiers, I effected my own ransom with another eight
hundred crowns. But on the advice of this trader the money was not paid
down to the Dey at once, lest his suspicions should be aroused, but he
was informed that it would shortly be forthcoming from Spain, and
meanwhile I remained in the Valencian&rsquo;s house upon parole. Before
Zoraida finally departed for her father&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>summer residence she gave us another thousand
crowns, explaining, by letter, that she kept the keys of her
father&rsquo;s treasury, and on this occasion I made arrangements for
ransoming three of my friends.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6744" class="main">The Flight from Algiers</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Soon after this the renegade purchased a vessel
capable of carrying above thirty people, in which he pretended to make
several voyages in company with a Moorish partner whom he took in order
to avoid suspicion. Each time he passed along the coast he cast anchor
in a little bay close to the house where Zoraida lived, so that the
people of the place should get used to his doing so. He even landed on
several occasions and begged fruit from Zoraida&rsquo;s father, which
he always received, for the old Moor was of a liberal spirit. But he
could never succeed in having speech with Zoraida herself. Our plan was
now upon such a footing that he asked me to fix a day upon which we
might make the great effort upon which everything depended. So I
collected twelve Spaniards known to be good oarsmen and whose comings
and goings were not very closely watched. It was arranged among us that
we should steal out of the town upon the evening of the next Friday,
and rendezvous at a certain spot near Agimorato&rsquo;s dwelling. But
it was necessary that Zoraida herself should be apprised of our
intention, and with this object in view I entered her garden one day
upon pretence of gathering a few herbs. Almost at once I encountered
her father, who asked me what I did there. I told him I was a slave of
Arnaut Mami, who I knew was a friend of his, and that I wanted a few
herbs to make up a salad. While we spoke Zoraida came out of the garden
house, and as it was quite the custom for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>the Moorish women to
be seen before Christian slaves, her father called her to come to him.
She was most richly dressed and wore a profusion of jewels, and now
that I beheld her for the first time I was astounded by her beauty. Her
father told her for what purpose I was there, and she asked me if I
were about to be ransomed. Speaking in <i lang="la">lingua franca</i>,
I replied that I had already been ransomed, and that I intended to
embark on the morrow upon a French ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that juncture the old Moor was called away upon business,
and I at once assured Zoraida that I would come for her on the morrow.
She immediately threw her arms around my neck and began to walk toward
the house, but her father returning at that moment espied us, and came
running to us in some alarm. Immediately Zoraida pretended to be in a
fainting condition, and explained to Agimorato that she had suddenly
felt indisposed. I yielded her up to him and they retired into the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next evening we embarked and dropped anchor opposite
Zoraida&rsquo;s dwelling. When darkness had come we walked boldly into
the garden, and finding the gate of the house open entered the
courtyard. Zoraida immediately emerged from the house carrying a small
trunk full of treasure, and told us that her father was asleep, but as
misfortune would have it, some slight noise that we made awakened him
and he came to a window calling out, &lsquo;Thieves, thieves!
Christians, Christians!&rsquo; The renegade at once rushed upstairs and
secured him, and we carried father and daughter on board. We also made
prisoners of the few Moors who remained on the vessel, bent to the
oars, and set out to sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href=
"#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;At first we endeavoured to make for Majorca, but a strong
wind arising, we were driven along the coast. We were in great fear
that we might encounter some of the Moorish cruisers which we knew to
be in the vicinity. I made every effort in my power to assure Agimorato
that we would give him his liberty on the very first occasion, and told
him that his daughter had become a Christian and desired to live the
rest of her life in a Christian land. On hearing this the old man
behaved as if suddenly seized with a frenzy, and rising cast himself
into the sea, whence we succeeded with difficulty in rescuing him.
Shortly afterward we drove into a small bay, where we set Agimorato
ashore. I shall never forget his curses and imprecations upon his
daughter, but as we sailed away he called out, begging her to return.
However, she hid her face in her hands and commended him to the
Virgin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had proceeded some little distance from the coast when the
light of the moon became obscured. All at once we nearly collided with
a large vessel, which hailed us in French, bidding us to heave to.
Perceiving that it was a French pirate, we made no answer, but pressed
onward, whereupon its crew launched a boat, boarded us and dragged us
on board, stripping Zoraida of all her jewels and throwing us into the
hold. As we neared the Spanish shore next morning they placed us in
their long-boat with two barrels of water and a small quantity of
biscuits, and the captain, touched with some remorse for the lovely
Zoraida, gave her at parting about forty crowns in gold. We rowed on
through the early dawn, and after some hours of plying the oars landed.
After proceeding some miles inland we came upon a shepherd, who on
seeing our Moorish dresses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href=
"#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>made off and gave the alarm. Soon
we encountered a company of horsemen, one of whom chanced to be related
to one of our number. They placed us on their horses and we soon
reached the city of Velez Malaga. There we went straight to church to
thank God for His great mercy to us, and there for the first time
Zoraida saw and recognized a picture of the Virgin. With some of the
money the pirate had given Zoraida I bought an ass and resolved to
discover whether or no my father and brothers were still alive. That
is, gentlemen, the sum of our adventures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The escaped Christian had scarcely finished his narration when a
splendid coach drove up to the door of the inn. From this equipage
there alighted a richly dressed gentleman and lady, who entered the
<i>posada</i> and were met with great courtesy by Don Quixote. The
Christian refugee recognized the gentleman as his brother, now a judge
of the Court of Mexico, who greeted him affectionately and introduced
the lady as his daughter. The man of many adventures with his Moorish
bride resolved to return with the judge to Seville, whence they
intended to advise their father of these strange happenings, that he
might come to see the baptism and marriage of Zoraida, for whose
future, and that of his sorely tried brother, the grandee resolved to
make ample provision.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6771" class="main">The Growth of Cervantes</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is in such a tale as the above that we observe how
Cervantes&rsquo; style grows more supple and adaptable as his work
proceeds. It is clear that he has made an effort to shake off the
literary trammels of his time, and that he has succeeded. No longer
does he find it necessary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href=
"#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>to imitate such writers as Antonio
de Guevara, as in the passage in which Don Quixote describes the Age of
Gold. He has shaken off the rather recondite euphuism of some of the
earlier passages, and has become more human and familiar. His speeches
are appropriate to his characters; his dialogue is full of life and his
narrative of incident. But although in these pages we behold the
evolution of a realist, Cervantes never altogether throws off the cloak
of academic eloquence&mdash;only it becomes a carefully restrained
eloquence which has left affectation far behind.</p>
<p>The great and immediate success of <i>Don Quixote</i> was, however,
principally due to its large humour, and to its faithful portraiture of
the Spanish types of Cervantes&rsquo; day. Into juxtaposition with
figures that were familiar to all he brought the extraordinary
character of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, a burlesque original
out of another age, and yet not lacking in the dignity and greater
qualities of the times whose spirit he strove to imitate. Into the
environment of seventeenth-century Spain stalked the antiquated figure
of Don Quixote, disturbing its ordinary routine and quarrelling with
its conventions, carrying the days of chivalry in his head, and
projecting their phantasms on the landscape by means of the all too
powerful light of his imagination. But if the incongruity of the Don in
a modern setting roused grave and sober Spain to inextinguishable
laughter, his character and that of Sancho Panza were still recognized
as triumphs of creative fiction&mdash;the representatives of
imagination run mad and of the grossest common sense.</p>
<p>The perfection and finish of <i>Don Quixote</i>, and the consummate
craftsmanship with which it is conceived, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>cannot fail to
commend themselves to readers of discretion. It is full of the
knowledge of the man of the world; it breathes leisure and urbanity,
its spirit is that which stamps the work of the great master. Here
there are no loose ends, no clumsy constructions, no weaknesses of
diction. It does not seem to me that Cervantes wrote with any great
facility, and herein probably lies the measure of his great literary
excellence. On the other hand, no drudgery is apparent in his
composition. He strikes the happy medium between brilliant facility and
that meticulous and often nervously apprehensive mode which so
frequently disgraces the work of modern stylists. He is precise and
wonderfully sure-footed, and we cannot imagine him grasping in alarm at
every projection in the course of his ascent. Whatever the secret of
his style, it succeeded in producing a wonderfully equable yet varied
narrative, just and appropriate in expression. His entire canvas is
filled in and completed with a masterly eye to the smallest detail.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6790" class="main">The Second Part of &ldquo;Don
Quixote&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We can see by the time which he permitted to elapse
between the first and second parts of his great romance how careful
Cervantes was not to hazard his well-won reputation upon an unfortunate
sequel, and the fictioneer of our own time, harassed by a public greedy
for sensation and flushed by momentary success, might well turn to him
for an example in this respect. It is often alleged that the
circumstances of modern literature do not permit of that leisure which
is necessary to the excogitation of a carefully developed technique or
a sound style. This, alas! is only too true. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>successful author of to-day can scarcely permit
ten months, much less ten years, to elapse between one effort and
another, and to this feverish condition of things we undoubtedly owe
those disappointing sequels to great novels with which all of us must
be only too familiar. Ours is emphatically not an age of connoisseurs.
We eat, drink, and read pretty much what is given us, and if we grumble
a little at the quality thereof, we feel that no complaints will alter
the conditions which produce the things against which we inveigh. The
Spain of Cervantes&rsquo; day offered a much more critical environment.
Bad or hastily conceived work it would not tolerate. But there were
elements within it which frequently did much to hasten the publication
of a sequel, and the chief of these was undoubtedly literary piracy.
Cervantes appears to have been spurred on in the publication of the
second part of <i>Don Quixote</i> by the appearance in 1614 of a book
by Alonso Fern&aacute;ndez de Avellaneda, a spurious sequel to the
first portion of his great work, the preface of which is filled with
personalities of the most insolent kind. That he resented the piracy is
shown by the circumstance that he put all his other work aside and
brought <i>Don Quixote</i> to a hurried conclusion.</p>
<p>In the last chapters of <i>Don Quixote</i> he was forced to write
hastily because his rival had stolen his plan, and it was necessary for
him to recast it as well as to bring out his novel with all speed. But,
these blemishes notwithstanding, much of the sequel is truly epical in
its grandeur. Don Quixote, if less amusing, is greatly more
thought-provoking, and Sancho Panza becomes even richer in common sense
and clear-sightedness. The portraiture of the remaining characters,
too, is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>sharper in outline than in the first part. The
sequel, indeed, is a great mirror in which the Spanish society of
Cervantes&rsquo; day is reflected with all the thaumaturgy of genius.
The immense success which followed it must have afforded the greatest
gratification to the dying novelist, and must in great measure have
consoled him for the disappointments of a career spent in the shallows
of exile and poverty.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6810" class="main">Lazarillo de Tormes</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The greatest humorous romance which Spain had produced
prior to <i>Don Quixote</i> was the <i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i> of Diego
Hurtado de Mendoza, a many-sided man and once Spanish Ambassador to
England. He was of noble extraction on both sides, and was born in
Granada in 1503. As a younger son he was destined for the Church, and
studied at the university of Salamanca, where, while still a student,
he wrote the novel which rendered him famous. Its graphic descriptions,
its penetration into character, and its vivacity and humour instantly
gained for it a high place in contemporary Spanish literature. But
Mendoza soon exchanged the clerical for the political sphere of
activity, and Charles V created him Captain-General of Siena, a small
Italian republic which had been brought beneath Spanish rule. Haughty
and unfeeling, Mendoza exercised a most tyrannical sway over the
wretched people committed to his care. They complained bitterly to the
Emperor regarding his conduct, and when this remained without effect,
his life was attempted by assassination. On one occasion, indeed, his
horse was killed under him by a musket-shot aimed at himself. During
his absence Siena was captured by a French army, and as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>the
weakness of the city was attributed to his withdrawal of certain troops
he was recalled to Spain in 1554.</p>
<p>But while thus employed in Italy as a statesman and a soldier
Mendoza had not been idle in a literary sense, for he had written his
political commentaries, a paraphrase of Aristotle, a treatise on
mechanics, and other notable works, none of which, however, have
achieved for him a tithe of the popularity of his first literary
effort.</p>
<p>Lazaro, or, to give him his diminutive name, Lazarillo, was the son
of a miller who plied his trade by the banks of the river Tormes, from
which he took his name. When he was only ten years old his father was
killed in a campaign against the Moors, and as his mother was unable to
support him she gave him into the charge of a blind man who wandered
about the country as a beggar. While at the bridge of Salamanca the boy
noticed an animal carved in stone in the form of a bull, and was told
by his master that if he placed his ear to the effigy he would hear it
roar. He did so, when the old man gave his head such a violent thump
against it as almost to bereave him of sense, and, laughing brutally,
told him that a blind man&rsquo;s boy must needs have his wits about
him. &ldquo;I have no silver or gold to give you,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but what is far better, I can impart to you the result of my
experiences, which will always enable you to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Lazarillo had much difficulty in getting enough food to
keep body and soul together. The old beggar kept his bread and meat in
a linen knapsack, the neck of which was tightly secured. But the boy
made a small rent in one of the seams of the bag, and thus helped
himself to the choicest pieces of meat, bacon, and <span class=

"pb384">384</a>]</span>sausage. It was his task also to receive the
alms which charitable people bestowed on the blind man, and part of
this he secreted in his mouth, until, by dint of practice, he was able
to hide a goodly treasure of copper money in that receptacle. It irked
him on a hot day to watch the beggar drinking his wine while he himself
went thirsty. The wine was kept in a large jar, and from time to time
he managed to get a sip of the cooling liquor. But his master soon
discovered the practice and kept the jar between his knees, with his
hand on its mouth. Lazarillo therefore bored a small hole in the bottom
of the jar, which he closed with wax. At dinner-time, when the blind
beggar sat over the fire, the wax melted, and Lazarillo, putting his
mouth to the hole, absorbed the wine. His master was enraged and
surprised when he found that the liquor had vanished, and attributed
its disappearance to magical means. But the next time his charge
attempted the feat the crafty old mendicant seized the jar with both
hands and dealt him such a blow on the face with it as to break the
vessel and wound the boy severely. From that day Lazarillo bore a
grudge against the sightless old tyrant, and took a sly revenge by
guiding him over the worst roads he could find and through the deepest
mud.</p>
<p>Resolving to quit a service the perquisites of which were all kicks
and no halfpence, Lazarillo led his master to the Arcade at Escalona,
beside which a brook ran rather swiftly. In order to cross this it was
necessary either to jump or to wade almost up to the neck in water, and
when this was explained to him the old beggar chose the former method
of negotiating it. The crafty Lazarillo told him that the narrowest
place was opposite a great stone pillar, and the wretched mendicant,
taking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>a step or two backward to give him impetus,
leapt with such force that he crashed into the pillar, at the bottom of
which he immediately fell unconscious. With a shout of triumph
Lazarillo ran off, and from that day never set eyes upon the blind man
again.</p>
<p>The next master whose service he entered was a priest, and if his
experiences with the beggar had been unhappy, they were as nothing to
what he now had to bear, for the holy man was a miser of the most
pitiful description, and starved him in a shameful manner. He kept his
bread in a large wooden chest, to which Lazarillo got a travelling
tinker to fit a key during the priest&rsquo;s absence, and was thus
able to regale himself daily, until his miserly master discovered the
shortage. This he attributed to rats, and as there were several holes
in the box he carefully mended it with small pieces of wood; but still
the bread disappeared, and as one of the neighbours had seen a snake in
the priest&rsquo;s domicile the padre concluded that this reptile was
the cause of the depredations. To avoid discovery, Lazarillo slept with
the key of the chest in his mouth, but one night his breathing caused a
whistling sound upon the orifice of the implement, and the old priest,
taking this for the hissing of the snake, delivered such a shrewd blow
in the direction of the noise as to render the unfortunate Lazarillo an
invalid for some considerable time. When he had recovered, the old
priest took him by the hand and, leading him into the street, said to
him: &ldquo;Lazarillo my son, thou hast great natural gifts; thou art
indeed far too clever for an old man like me, and I assure thee that I
do not wish to see thee more. Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lazarillo, however, was not long in attaching himself to another
master, who appeared to be a gentleman of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb386" href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>birth and breeding.
But now he found that he was in worse straits than ever, as though his
master seemed a cavalier of family, he had not a penny in the world,
and was entirely dependent for his daily bread upon what the boy could
beg from charitably disposed persons. One day the landlord called for
the rent, and the gentleman, assuring him that he would fetch it from
his banker&rsquo;s, sallied forth and never returned, so that once more
the wretched urchin was without a master.</p>
<p>He next succeeded in obtaining the patronage of a pardoner who
travelled from place to place selling indulgences and relics. On one
occasion they stayed at an inn, where his master struck up a friendship
with an <i>alguazil</i>, or constable. One night the pair sat late
carousing, when a quarrel arose between them, and next day, as the
pardoner was preaching in the church preparatory to selling his wares,
the <i>alguazil</i> entered and denounced him as an impostor. The
pardoner, with a great show of piety, prayed loudly that the heavenly
powers would vindicate his character and would punish the
<i>alguazil</i>, who immediately fell to the ground in the most
dreadful convulsions. Some of the congregation prayed the pardoner that
he would attempt some mitigation of the wrath of heaven upon his
traducer, and the holy man stepped from the pulpit and laid a bull
which he pretended he had received from the Pope upon the
sufferer&rsquo;s forehead. The man instantly rose as if cured, and the
people, convinced that a miracle had occurred, at once bought up the
pardoner&rsquo;s entire stock. But the acute Lazarillo soon discovered
that the pair had been in league with one another.</p>
<p>The last master to whose service Lazarillo attached himself was the
Arch-priest of Salvador, in whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387"
href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>service he flourished
exceedingly, and one of whose servants he married. But scandal crept
into his household, and with the death of his wife he found himself as
poor as ever.</p>
<p>Here the tale ends. It is impossible in such a brief sketch as this
to do justice to the great degree of insight into the workings of the
human heart which characterizes the authorship of this little novel,
the first of its kind. <i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i> was the forerunner
and exemplar of the entire school of the Picaresque novel, which at a
later date became almost typical of Spanish fiction, and which gave
rise to such masterpieces as <i>Guzman de Alfarache</i>, the <i>Gil
Blas</i> of Le Sage, and the novels of Scarron, and the spirit of which
to some extent was mirrored in our own Laurence Sterne; nor is its
influence by any means defunct, as can readily be seen by reference to
certain of the works of Mr Maurice Hewlett and Mr Jeffery Farnol.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mateo Aleman, the author of the great Picaresque
romance of <i>Guzman de Alfarache</i>, was a native of Seville.
Throwing up a Government appointment in early life, he crossed the sea
to Mexico, where in 1609 he published a work on Spanish orthography and
several treatises in Latin. But the effort which has gained for him the
title of novelist was his <i>Vita del Picaro Guzman de Alfarache</i>, a
work which has been translated into every European language from the
date of its first appearance in 1599. Although written in the most
correct and approved literary style, it is yet easy and familiar in
manner, and is unrivalled in the picture it presents not only of the
lowest grades of Castilian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href=
"#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>society, but of the more exclusive
orders of life at the period in which he wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ancestors,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;were originally from the
Levant, but settled in Genoa and employed themselves in the mercantile
life of that city in such a manner that they were accused of
usury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the stock from which the lively adventurer came was of such a
character as to bring him at an early age into contact with the
realities of roguery. But if his relations were by no means particular
in trade, they concealed their ignominious conduct under the cloak of
hypocrisy and social correctness. They never failed to be present at
Mass, and the finger of reproach could not be pointed against their
family life. Before Guzman was born his father learned that one of his
correspondents at Seville had become bankrupt, and setting out for
Spain in order to investigate his affairs on the spot, he was captured
by an Algerine pirate, adopted the religion of Mohammed, and married a
Moorish lady. His agent at Seville, having heard of what had happened
to his principal creditor, adjusted his affairs without him, and was
soon in a better condition than ever. But the elder de Alfarache
succeeded in making his escape, and, coming to Seville, demanded a
reckoning from his rascally business <i>confr&egrave;re</i>, from whom
he succeeded in extorting a considerable sum. He set himself up in
business at Seville, and bought an estate, which he named St Juan de
Alfarache. Here he lived right royally, and, having married the wealthy
widow of an old knight, he found himself in a fortunate position. Soon
after this his son Guzman was born. But de Alfarache was unfortunately
prone to the distractions of company, splendour, and show, and having
dissipated most of his means, ere long <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>became himself
bankrupt, and shortly afterward paid the debt of nature.</p>
<p>His widow and the little Guzman were only indifferently provided
for, and when the boy had entered his fourteenth year he resolved to
seek his fortune, and set out for Genoa, in the hope that his
father&rsquo;s relations would extend their assistance to him. Soon he
arrived at a miserable tavern, where he asked for something to eat, and
was given an omelet, which, he says, might more properly have been
called an &ldquo;egg poultice,&rdquo; but which he attacked &ldquo;as
hogs do acorns.&rdquo; Leaving the inn, he soon felt very ill, and in a
condition bordering upon collapse he encountered a muleteer, to whom he
described the unsavoury meal he had just eaten, and who laughed
heartily at his story. The kindly fellow told him to jump on one of his
mules, and soon they were trotting nimbly eastward. Shortly after this
they met two friars, and arrived at an inn, where they were given
another indifferent meal, which the host extolled so much that the
simple boy was fain to swallow the mess without making any great ado.
But to his horror he later discovered that it had been made from the
flesh of a young mule. On being challenged with this the innkeeper drew
a long sword, whereupon the muleteer seized a pitchfork, and murder
would have been done had not the town police separated the parties. The
dishonest landlord was taken to prison, but although he confessed to
passing off the mule for veal he would not admit that he had stolen
Guzman&rsquo;s cloak, which had gone amissing, and the boy had perforce
to leave the place minus this article of apparel.</p>
<p>Riding on their way, Guzman and the muleteer were soon overtaken on
the road by two persons on mules, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390"
href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>who examined them with the
greatest attention, and then quite suddenly threw themselves upon the
unfortunate lad, asserting that he had stolen some jewels of value. The
muleteer interfered, but only to receive a rough handling, and the
strangers tied the comrades to their mules with cords. At this juncture
the party was joined once more by the friars, who amused themselves by
telling tales, the morals of which hinged upon the mutability of human
affairs; but these are much too long and too slightly connected with
the thread of our story to be repeated here. The party then arrived at
the gates of Cazalla, and the officers of the law, finding that they
had made a mistake in arresting Guzman, gave him his liberty. He put up
at the best inn that the place afforded, and on the following morning
took the direct road to Madrid on foot. At an inn on the outskirts of
the capital he met with a beneficent priest, who shared his meal with
him, but in the morning the landlord attempted to overcharge him, and
was about to take his coat in payment of his bill when the muleteer,
who had rejoined him, interfered, and gave it as his opinion that
Guzman had run away from home. The villainous landlord, seeing in this
some hope of enriching himself, offered to take the lad into his
service as a kind of stable-boy, his duty being to hand out straw and
oats to the muleteers who put up at the place. Here the young Guzman
was initiated into habits of dishonesty and sharp practice, for when a
cavalier or person of consequence visited the inn he usually doled out
a mere handful of provender to his horses or mules, while charging him
the usual sum for it. The place was, indeed, a regular sink of
iniquity, and for Guzman life became so miserable that, relying
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>upon the little money he had saved, and selling
his coat and waistcoat, he absconded, and joined a passing company of
beggars. These people lived right royally on what they begged and what
they poached. They were inveterate gamblers, and in the evening Guzman
found every opportunity of picking up tricks with playing-cards. Soon
after, however, he took employment as scullion to a cook in the service
of a nobleman.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 id="xd19e6897" class="main">Guzman as Scullion</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this situation Guzman passed a jovial time, for
there was no lack of good cheer in the knight&rsquo;s establishment.
Albeit the lad did his work to admiration. But the vice of gambling
seized upon him, and every day he joined the lackeys and pages at
cards, often sitting up all night to indulge in this pastime. In this
way he soon got rid of the money he received in gratuities, and being
short of funds wherewith to gratify his passion for gaming, began to
pilfer such small articles as he could find about the house, excusing
himself by saying that he only did as others did. One day his master
had given a great carouse to some friends, and Guzman entered the room
where they had been drinking to find them fast asleep. On the table he
observed a large silver goblet, and this he purloined. The cook&rsquo;s
wife soon missed the article, and inquiries with regard to it were set
afoot, whereupon the cunning youngster, taking the cup to a jeweller,
had it cleaned in such a manner that it resembled a new one. Carrying
it back to the woman, who was in great fear that her master would hear
of the loss, he told her that he had found a similar goblet at a
jeweller&rsquo;s, which he could procure for fifty-six <i>reales</i>,
and, anxious to avert trouble, she at once gave him the sum to purchase
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>it. The money thus dishonestly won was instantly
thrown in gaming, and Guzman was no better off than before.</p>
<p>About this time the cook was requested to prepare a splendid dinner
for a foreign nobleman who had newly arrived at Madrid. A large sack
containing game was entrusted to the lad, and this he carried home, but
as it was late he took it up to his own garret. In the middle of the
night he was wakened by cats, who fought over one of the hares which he
had brought home. Seeing that this was not missed, and that his brother
lackeys stole the provisions right and left, Guzman presently slipped
half a dozen eggs into his pocket. But the head cook observed him do
so, and dealt him such a furious kick that he fell, and the broken eggs
gushed from his pocket, to the amusement of all present. Guzman,
however, managed to embezzle a couple of partridges and some quails.
These he took to sell to another cook, but his master, suspecting him,
followed and discovered what he was about, and immediately dismissed
him after thrashing him soundly.</p>
<p>After this nothing was left for the young adventurer but to return
to his old trade of running errands. He soon heard that certain troops
were about to be embarked for Genoa, and resolved to follow them and
enlist. A certain old apothecary, who had always found him honest in
his dealings, sent him to a foreign merchant with a large quantity of
silver, and this Guzman secreted in a large hole by the riverside. In
the morning he returned to the place, and, digging up the bags of
money, found that they contained two thousand five hundred
<i>reales</i> in silver and thirty <i>pistoles</i> in gold. Slinging
the bags on his back, to resemble a traveller&rsquo;s pack, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>set off in the direction of Toledo, making his
way across the fields and carefully avoiding the high road.</p>
<p>Arriving within two leagues of Toledo, he entered a wood, where he
intended to rest the whole of the day, as he did not wish to approach
the city till nightfall. His plan was to betake himself to Genoa and
introduce himself to his relations, and he was thinking of the best way
to lay out his money in order to reach them and make a good appearance
before them, when he heard a noise and, turning hastily, beheld a young
man of about his own age reclining on the ground, with his head against
a tree. Guzman shared his wine with him, and the youth informed him
that he was penniless. Guzman offered to buy some of the clothes he
carried with him in a bundle, and, opening one of his money-bags,
reassured him as to his ability to pay. For a hundred <i>reales</i> a
handsome suit changed hands, and, taking leave of the stranger, Guzman
entered Toledo, where he at once put up at the best inn. Next day he
fitted himself out with such articles of attire as he required, but his
vanity got the better of him, and he ordered a most magnificent suit,
which cost him a long price. On Sunday he betook himself to the
cathedral, where he met a very fine lady, who asked him to accompany
her home to supper. For this occasion Guzman ordered a magnificent
feast, but the pair had hardly sat down to partake of it when a loud
knocking was heard at the door, and the lady cried out in alarm that
her brother had returned and that he had better conceal himself. The
only place in which he could do so with advantage was inside a great
inverted bath, and from this place of concealment he had the
mortification of beholding the gentleman who entered devour the
gorgeous supper which he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href=
"#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>provided and drink every drop of
the four bottles of wine he had purchased for his own use. Soon the
gentleman, having eaten and drunk thus sumptuously, fell sound asleep,
and Guzman took the opportunity of stealing from the house, a sadder
but a wiser lad.</p>
<p>Hearing that an <i>alguazil</i> had been inquiring very particularly
regarding him, Guzman hurriedly left Toledo, and, arriving at the town
of Almagro, joined the company of soldiers who were bound for Genoa.
Their captain, taken with his distinguished appearance, hailed him as a
brother in arms, and treated him as an equal. Guzman had engaged the
services of a page at Toledo, and this little rascal assisted him
greatly in his new sphere by spreading the report that he was a
gentleman of consequence. But our hero&rsquo;s purse was now sadly
depleted, although he had still about half of his ill-gotten gains
left. Instead of embarking at once the company remained at Barcelona
for three months, so that his resources soon gave out, and he was
neglected by the officers, and even avoided by the soldiers. His
captain, indeed, condoled with him, and offered him a place in his
household at the servants&rsquo; table, assuring him that this was all
he could do for him, as he himself was compelled to dine out from his
utter incapacity to receive his friends at home. Guzman assured him of
his gratitude, and hinted that he might in turn be able to assist him.
The soldiers were billeted in the village, and Guzman commenced a
system of imposing a larger number of men upon each house than was
necessary, or at least threatening to do so, so that the anxious
inhabitants were only too glad to buy him off. In this manner he
completely re-established the captain&rsquo;s finances, and as presents
of provisions poured in from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href=
"#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>the frightened villagers the young
rascal and his chief lived well. But he now grew bolder, and, selecting
half a dozen of the most desperate men in the company, began to rob
passengers on the high road. His captain, learning of this, however,
immediately put a stop to such dangerous proceedings.</p>
<p>One day Guzman observed that among the few jewels the captain still
had left to him there was a very handsome gold reliquary set with
diamonds, and this he begged his superior to lend him for a few days.
The audacious stripling at once took it to a jeweller&rsquo;s, to whom
he offered it for two hundred crowns. But the man would only tender him
a hundred and twenty, and this Guzman refused. The jeweller called upon
him next day to renew his offer, which the lad accepted. Guzman handed
him the purse in which the reliquary was kept, receiving the hundred
and twenty crowns in exchange. But the old fellow had scarcely left the
house when the young adventurer raised a cry of &ldquo;Stop thief! Stop
thief!&rdquo; Some soldiers immediately arrested the jeweller, and
Guzman cried out that he had robbed him of the captain&rsquo;s
reliquary. The jeweller assured the arquebusiers that he had paid a
hundred and twenty crowns for the article, but this Guzman denied. The
wretched goldsmith was haled before a magistrate, and, as he had a bad
reputation for usury, was forced to disgorge the reliquary. But
although the captain was glad enough to get the money thus scurvily
gained, he feared that further association with such a rascal as de
Alfarache would ruin him. In a few days the company set sail for Genoa,
and when they had arrived there his superior intimated that they must
part, at the same time thrusting a <i>pistole</i> into his hand.

<p class="first">The young adventurer now began to make inquiries about
his relations, and was informed that they were the most rich and
powerful persons in the republic. He inquired the way to their mansion,
where he was but ill received, all the more so as his appearance was
shabby in the extreme. But as he had taken care to make his
relationship to them public property, they could not very well repulse
him. One evening he met a venerable-looking old man, who told him that
he had known his father, and that he felt quite indignant at the
behaviour of his relations toward him, and offered him an asylum at his
own house. Without giving him anything to eat, he at once sent him to
bed, where the wretched lad lay tormented by the pangs of hunger.
Before he went to sleep the old man informed him that the room he
occupied had the reputation of being haunted by evil spirits. Famished
and restless, Guzman lay awake, when to his horror four figures in the
shape of devils entered the chamber and dragged him out of bed.
Throwing him into a blanket, they tossed him in the air with such
violence that he struck the ceiling again and again, until, exhausted
by the exercise, they placed him in bed once more and departed. In the
early morning, stiff, sore, and dejected, Guzman crawled from the
mansion, but he registered an oath never to forget the detestable
manner in which his acquaintance had treated him, and resolved to be
avenged upon him at the first opportunity.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Leaving Genoa in this miserable plight, in which he
compares himself to one of those who escaped from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>battle of Roncesvalles, Guzman resolved to make
his way to Rome. Italy, he says, is the most charitable country in the
world, and anyone who can beg can travel within its bounds without
concerning himself about his next meal. In a few weeks he found himself
in the Roman Catholic capital, with money enough in his pocket to buy a
new suit of clothes, but he resisted the temptation to do so, and
wandered about the streets of the Imperial city seeking alms. He soon
fell in with a comrade in distress, who enlightened him regarding the
manners and customs of the beggars of Rome and who gave him such good
instructions that he soon received more money than he could spend. In a
short time Guzman was a perfect master of the trade of begging. After
spending some weeks in this kind of life he fell in with one of the
master-beggars of the city, who instructed him in the laws of begging,
which he sets forth at length in his autobiography. These laws Guzman
got by heart. The beggars lived together, and met in the evening to
practise and invent new exclamations to excite pity. In the morning
there was usually a scramble among them to see who could get nearest
the holy water at the entrance to the churches, for there it was that
the greatest harvest was reaped, and in the evening the beggars usually
made a round of the country seats in the neighbourhood of Rome, whence
they returned laden with provisions. Nearly all of the beggars were
adepts at simulating bodily malformations or loathsome diseases. On one
occasion, in the town of Gaeta, Guzman simulated a terrible disease of
the head, and the Governor, who was passing, gave him alms. Next day he
sat at the porch of a church with what appeared to be a grievous
affection of the leg, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href=
"#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>much money was flowing in upon
him, when unhappily the Governor chanced to pass, and recognizing him,
told him that he would give him some cast-off clothing if he would
follow him home. Arrived there the Governor asked him by what singular
remedy he had contrived to cure himself of his former complaint within
the short space of one day, and without waiting for an answer sent for
a surgeon, who, on examining the leg, assured the Governor that it was
perfectly sound. The Governor then handed Guzman over to his lackeys,
who trounced him severely and thrust him forth from the town.</p>
<p>One morning our rascally hero had posted himself at the gate of a
certain Cardinal celebrated for his compassionate disposition, who, on
passing and hearing his plaint, told his domestics to convey the
seeming sufferer to a chamber in his mansion and attend to his wants.
Guzman had once more simulated a terrible disease of the leg, and the
Cardinal, observing this, sent for two of the most celebrated surgeons
in Rome. Their preparations were of such a nature that Guzman feared
they were about to amputate his leg, so when they consulted together in
an adjoining room he went to the door to listen to what they were
saying. One of them gave it as his opinion that the disorder was merely
a bogus one, but the other as warmly maintained that it was genuine. At
length they agreed to lay their deliberations before the Cardinal, and
were about to do so when Guzman, entering the room where they
consulted, admitted his fraud, and proposed that they should combine in
deceiving the Cardinal. To this the surgeons agreed, and when his
Eminence appeared they made the most alarming and touching report
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>regarding Guzman&rsquo;s sham disorder. The
Cardinal, who was a man of lofty character and unsuspicious nature,
begged them to take as much time as they thought proper in effecting a
cure, and to neglect nothing that might contribute to the
patient&rsquo;s recovery. So anxious were the surgeons to pile up their
fees that they compelled Guzman to keep his bed for three months, which
appeared three ages to him, so keen was his desire to return to the
gaming which had become second nature to him. At the end of this time
they presented their bill to the Cardinal, telling him that a complete
cure had been effected, and so pleased was the churchman at having
assisted in so remarkable a case, and so keen his appreciation of
Guzman&rsquo;s native wit, that he ended by taking the youthful
charlatan into his service as one of his pages.</p>
<p>Guzman was, however, not very well satisfied with his new life,
which in great measure consisted in waiting in ante-chambers and
serving at table. The discipline was rigorous, and all that he could
purloin was a few candle-ends. But he found that a large quantity of
very fine preserved fruit was kept in a certain chest, and to this he
applied himself. The Cardinal discovered the peculation, yet failed to
trace it to its source; but when Guzman was rifling the chest on a
second occasion his Eminence entered and caught him in the act. He
received a thorough castigation at the hands of the major-domo, which
put an end to his knaveries for some considerable time.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But Guzman played so many tricks in the
Cardinal&rsquo;s palace that at length this excellent prelate had to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>dispense with his services. He then entered the
service of the Spanish Ambassador, who was a friend of the
Cardinal&rsquo;s, and who knew all about our hero&rsquo;s capacities.
After some considerable time spent in the service of this dignitary,
Guzman resolved to leave Rome for a tour through Italy. Shortly before
this he had encountered a Spaniard called Sayavedra, with whom he
became very friendly. Provided with about three hundred <i>pistoles</i>
and some jewels, which he had purloined from the ambassador, Guzman set
out on his travels. But Sayavedra had taken a wax impression of
Guzman&rsquo;s keys, and pilfered his luggage before he left, so that
if it had not been for the generosity of the ambassador he could not
have left Rome. At Siena, however, Guzman fell in with Sayavedra once
more, who entreated him to pardon his perfidy, and offered to become
his servant. Guzman, who was sorry for his miserable condition, agreed
to the proposal, and the pair, going to Florence, began to concert
measures for improving their position. It was bruited abroad that
Guzman was a nephew of the Spanish Ambassador, and he even had the
insolence to present himself at Court, where he was received by the
Grand Duke in that capacity. Here he met a charming widow of great
wealth, with whom he fell violently in love. But her relatives, making
inquiries about him, discovered that he had once begged in the streets
of Rome, and he was forced to leave the city. At Bologna he gained a
good deal of money at play, and on arriving at Milan he and Sayavedra
took apartments in that city and cast about for some means of putting
their newly acquired funds to use. Here they soon fell in with a
rascally friend employed as clerk in a banker&rsquo;s house, and
concerted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>with him as to how they should relieve his
master of his surplus wealth. Guzman called upon the banker and told
him he wished to deposit with him about twelve thousand francs in gold.
He was well received, and the financier entered his name and other
particulars in his daybook. On his way home he bought a gilt casket,
which he filled with pieces of lead, and, giving this to Sayavedra,
along with a bag of real money, enjoined that he should get into
conversation with the landlord of the inn where they were staying, and
tell him that he was taking the cash to the banker&rsquo;s
house&mdash;which of course he was not to do. The banker&rsquo;s clerk
got false keys made to fit his master&rsquo;s coffer, and, when the
latter was at Mass on Sunday, he opened it and placed therein the gilt
casket, which, instead of lead, now contained ten quadruples, thirty
Roman crowns, and a written account of its contents. He then
counterfeited his master&rsquo;s handwriting, and completed the entry
in the daybook which he had begun, making it appear that not only the
casket, but all the money in the coffer, had been credited to
Guzman.</p>
<p>On the Monday Guzman called at the banker&rsquo;s and asked him very
politely to return the cash that had been sent to him a few days
before. The man naturally denied that any sum had been lodged with him
at all, whereupon Guzman made so great an outcry that a large crowd
collected, and the quarrel assumed such a serious aspect that a
constable appeared on the scene, accompanied by the landlord of the inn
at which Guzman was staying. Guzman asserted that if the banker&rsquo;s
books were examined the sum he mentioned would be found noted in them,
and on the daybook being produced this was proved to be the case. The
wretched banker admitted that part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402"
href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>of the writing was in his own
hand, and this was sufficient to incense the crowd, with whom he had a
very bad reputation for usury and sharp practice. Guzman, too, was able
to give a most circumstantial account of the contents of the coffer,
which, on being opened, was found, to the banker&rsquo;s amazement, to
contain the gilt casket he spoke of and the exact sum named by him,
including even the various coinages he had enumerated and the written
note of its contents. The landlord was able to corroborate
Guzman&rsquo;s ownership of the casket, and as the evidence seemed
conclusive the local magistrate awarded him the money, which he divided
with his confederates.</p>
<p>Guzman now resolved to return to Genoa for the purpose of being
revenged upon the relatives who had treated him so scurvily upon his
previous visit to that city. Disguising himself as a Spanish abbot of
consequence, he put up at the best inn of the place, and his relatives,
learning of his arrival, and of the pomp he displayed, hastened to pay
their respects to him. They failed to identify him with the ragged and
friendless urchin who had sought their assistance some years before,
and his uncle even retailed the adventure of the devils to him as if it
had been played upon an impostor. Guzman completely gained their
confidence, and as he had plenty of money to spare they readily
entrusted to his keeping a valuable collection of jewels, which he told
them a friend desired to borrow for his wedding ceremony. With these he
and Sayavedra made off to Spain, but on the way the latter fell ill of
a fever, and, rushing on the deck of the galley, threw himself
overboard and was drowned.</p>
<p>Guzman, reaching his native country, after a number <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>of
adventures arrived in Madrid, where he sold his jewels to a rich
merchant, who, believing him to be a person of consequence, gave him
his daughter in marriage. The merchant relied upon Guzman&rsquo;s
supposed wealth to further his financial operations, Guzman relied upon
his father-in-law&rsquo;s equally supposititious resources, and as the
extravagant young wife relied on both, all were soon plunged into
bankruptcy. The shock was too much for the lady, and she expired, but
her cunning parent succeeded in saving sufficient from the wreck to
commence business once more.</p>
<p>Guzman, however, was tired of the world of finance, and decided to
invest the remainder of his ill-gotten gains in studying for the
Church. With this object in view, he betook himself to the university
of Alcal&agrave; de Henares, where he took his Bachelor of Arts degree,
and after four years&rsquo; hard reading at divinity only awaited a
benefice to permit him to graduate as a full-fledged priest, when evil
influences once more began to beset him. He made the acquaintance of a
lady who had a family of daughters, with one of whom he became
infatuated, and whom he married. The pair betook themselves to Madrid,
where they embarked upon an adventurous career, after some years of
which the lady eloped, taking with her everything of value which she
could lay hands upon. By this time Guzman had presented himself to his
mother, who, so far from dissuading him from his evil courses, assisted
him in his schemes of roguery, so that shortly, going from bad to
worse, he found himself doomed to a long period of servitude in the
royal galleys. But here he was able to assist the authorities in
discovering a mutiny, for which he was rewarded with his freedom.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span></p>
<p>At this stage we take our leave of the most consummate rogue in
fiction; but if Guzman de Alfarache is perhaps the most wily scoundrel
in the records of romance, he is certainly one of the most original and
amusing. It is noticeable, however, that his career, on the whole, was
not a remunerative one, and that when he makes his farewell bow to us
he is no better off than when we first encountered him. Perhaps the
most amusing thing about his narrative is the sham propriety of tone in
which it is couched&mdash;a style which was almost slavishly copied by
Le Sage in his <i>Gil Blas</i>, who was not only obliged to this novel
for its general atmosphere, but for many of the incidents which occur
in his celebrated work.</p>

<h3 id="xd19e6989" class="main">Conclusion</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have trodden the ways of Spanish story, sublime,
mock-heroic, and humorous. Perhaps no chapter in the world&rsquo;s
literature is so rich in colour, or displays such a variety of mood and
sentiment. Still the key-note is one of noble and dignified beauty, of
chivalrous distinction, of exquisite propriety, courteous, immaculate,
and unspotted by vulgarity or sordid meanness. The wine-cup of Spanish
romance is filled with the heart&rsquo;s blood of a nation august,
knightly, imaginative, a people who have preferred ideals to gross
realities, and the heights of national aristocracy to the deserts of
false democracy<span class="corr" id="xd19e6993" title=
"Not in source">.</span> &ldquo;Poor Spain!&rdquo; How often does the
Anglo-Saxon utter the phrase in complacent self-assurance? With the
solace of such a treasure-house of poetic and romantic wealth as she
possesses, Spain may well rest in assured hope of the return of the
brave days in praise of which her trovadores struck the lyre and her
poets sang in stately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href=
"#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>epic. Poor Spain! Nay, golden
Spain&mdash;enchanted cavern, glowing with the spoil of song, the
rainbow treasure of legend, and the gem-like radiance of immortal
romance!</p>

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
